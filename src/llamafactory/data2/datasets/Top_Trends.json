With smart contracts and blockchain, DeFi removes intermediaries and provides users with direct control over their assets. Yield farming, staking, and decentralized exchanges are some of the most popular DeFi applications. However, the industry also faces challenges such as regulatory uncertainty and smart contract vulnerabilities. As DeFi matures, scalability solutions like Layer 2 protocols and zero-knowledge rollups are becoming critical for mass adoption.",
