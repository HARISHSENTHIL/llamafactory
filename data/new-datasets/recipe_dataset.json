Ingredients:['1 (3\u00bd\u20134-lb.) whole chicken', '2\u00be tsp. kosher salt, divided, plus more', '2 small acorn squash (about 3 lb. total)', '2 Tbsp. finely chopped sage', '1 Tbsp. finely chopped rosemary', '6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted, plus 3 Tbsp. room temperature', '\u00bc tsp. ground allspice', 'Pinch of crushed red pepper flakes', 'Freshly ground black pepper', '\u2153 loaf good-quality sturdy white bread, torn into 1\" pieces (about 2\u00bd cups)', '2 medium apples (such as Gala or Pink Lady; about 14 oz. total), cored, cut into 1\" pieces', '2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil', '\u00bd small red onion, thinly sliced', '3 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar', '1 Tbsp. white miso', '\u00bc cup all-purpose flour', '2 Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature', '\u00bc cup dry white wine', '2 cups unsalted chicken broth', '2 tsp. white miso', 'Kosher salt', 'freshly ground pepper']. Steps:Pat chicken dry with paper towels, season all over with 2 tsp. salt, and tie legs together with kitchen twine. Let sit at room temperature 1 hour.\nMeanwhile, halve squash and scoop out seeds. Run a vegetable peeler along ridges of squash halves to remove skin. Cut each half into \u00bd\"-thick wedges; arrange on a rimmed baking sheet.\nCombine sage, rosemary, and 6 Tbsp. melted butter in a large bowl; pour half of mixture over squash on baking sheet. Sprinkle squash with allspice, red pepper flakes, and \u00bd tsp. salt and season with black pepper; toss to coat.\nAdd bread, apples, oil, and \u00bc tsp. salt to remaining herb butter in bowl; season with black pepper and toss to combine. Set aside.\nPlace onion and vinegar in a small bowl; season with salt and toss to coat. Let sit, tossing occasionally, until ready to serve.\nPlace a rack in middle and lower third of oven; preheat to 425\u00b0F. Mix miso and 3 Tbsp. room-temperature butter in a small bowl until smooth. Pat chicken dry with paper towels, then rub or brush all over with miso butter. Place chicken in a large cast-iron skillet and roast on middle rack until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155\u00b0F, 50\u201360 minutes. (Temperature will climb to 165\u00b0F while chicken rests.) Let chicken rest in skillet at least 5 minutes, then transfer to a plate; reserve skillet.\nMeanwhile, roast squash on lower rack until mostly tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and scatter reserved bread mixture over, spreading into as even a layer as you can manage. Return to oven and roast until bread is golden brown and crisp and apples are tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven, drain pickled onions, and toss to combine. Transfer to a serving dish.\nUsing your fingers, mash flour and butter in a small bowl to combine.\nSet reserved skillet with chicken drippings over medium heat. You should have about \u00bc cup, but a little over or under is all good. (If you have significantly more, drain off and set excess aside.) Add wine and cook, stirring often and scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, until bits are loosened and wine is reduced by about half (you should be able to smell the wine), about 2 minutes. Add butter mixture; cook, stirring often, until a smooth paste forms, about 2 minutes. Add broth and any reserved drippings and cook, stirring constantly, until combined and thickened, 6\u20138 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in miso. Taste and season with salt and black pepper.\nServe chicken with gravy and squash panzanella alongside.",

Ingredients:['8 anchovies, mashed to a paste', '8 garlic cloves, finely grated', '6 Tbsp. mayonnaise, divided', '1 Tbsp. Dijon mustard, plus more for serving', '2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided', '1\u00bd tsp. freshly ground black pepper, plus more', '1 (3\u00bd\u20134-lb.) whole chicken or 4 chicken legs (thigh and drumstick; about 3 lb.)', 'Kosher salt', '8 medium shallots, unpeeled, halved lengthwise', '2 lemons, divided', '1 oz. Parmesan, finely grated', '4 oz. country-style bread, torn into (1\u00bd\") pieces', '2 romaine hearts', 'leaves separated', 'torn']. Steps:Place a rack in lower third of oven; preheat to 450\u00b0F. Whisk anchovies, garlic, 3 Tbsp. mayonnaise, 1 Tbsp. mustard, 1 Tbsp. oil, and 1\u00bd tsp. pepper in a small bowl. Set aside 1 Tbsp. anchovy mayo in another small bowl.\nPat chicken dry; season outside and inside all over with salt. Arrange breast side up in a cast-iron skillet and tuck wings underneath. Arrange shallots around (if using legs, nestle under and around); season with salt and pepper. Brush remaining anchovy mayo all over chicken, making sure to get it into the nooks and crannies, then brush shallots with any leftover anchovy mayo.\nPlace chicken in oven so legs are facing toward the back (this is the hottest part of the oven and will help the legs cook before the breast dries out) and roast until some anchovy mayo and fat begin to drip onto shallots, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and, using tongs, turn shallots to coat in drippings. Return skillet to oven and continue to roast chicken, stirring shallots once or twice, until golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155\u00b0F, 45\u201355 minutes. If skin starts to get too dark on the top before chicken is done, tent area with foil, leaving the rest of the bird exposed. If using chicken legs, start checking at 40 minutes (a thermometer inserted right at the joint should register 160\u00b0F). Transfer chicken and shallots to a cutting board, leaving behind any juices and fat in skillet. If shallots need more time to soften and darken, roast a bit longer without chicken before proceeding. Reserve skillet.\nReduce oven temperature to 400\u00b0F. Finely grate half of zest of 1 lemon into a large bowl; cut lemon in half and squeeze in juice. Add reserved 1 Tbsp. anchovy mayo, remaining 3 Tbsp. mayo, and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil and whisk to combine, then stir in Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper. Set dressing aside.\nAdd bread to reserved skillet with fat and turn to coat. Return skillet to oven and toast bread, tossing halfway through, until golden brown and crisp, 12\u201315 minutes. Transfer croutons to bowl with reserved dressing. Add romaine and gently toss until lettuce is well coated. Season salad with salt and pepper.\nSlice remaining lemon into wedges. Carve chicken and nestle back into skillet or transfer to a platter; arrange shallots and lemon wedges around. Serve with salad and more mustard alongside.",

Steps:Place the zest strips in a small saucepan and cover with water. Bring the water to a boil, then drain. Repeat this process two more times (blanching the orange zest removes any bitter flavors). Place the ginger and orange zest in a jar or heatproof container. In a saucepan, bring the lime juice, vinegar, sugar, and \u00be teaspoon salt to a boil. Pour over the ginger and orange. Let cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate overnight. The pickled ginger can be refrigerated for a couple of months.\nDrain the pickled ginger and orange and save 3 tablespoons of the pickling liquid. Add both to a blender or mini food processor, along with the olive oil, chile, and remaining 2 tablespoons salt. Blend until very smooth, scraping down the side of the blender as needed. Transfer to a container and refrigerate until ready to use. The puree can be made a couple of days ahead. (Makes about 1 cup.)\nPreheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Place the beets in a baking dish (if using a mix of red and golden beets, separate them into two smaller dishes and divide the oil, vinegar, and water between the two dishes). Drizzle with the oil and add the water and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Cover the pan with foil and roast until the beets are tender when pierced with a knife; this can take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the thickness of the beets. Let the beets cool, then peel and cut into 1-inch wedges. Place each color of beet, along with any accumulated juices, into a small mixing bowl.\nIn a skillet, heat the oil over medium-low heat. Add the cashews and cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown. Transfer to a heat-proof bowl.\nPour 1 inch of oil into a small saucepan and add the sunchokes (there should be just enough oil to cover the sunchokes; add more oil if needed). Turn the heat to medium and stir occasionally; when the sunchokes begin to sizzle and foam, increase the temperature to high and continue frying, stirring constantly, until the sunchokes are light golden brown. At this point the sunchokes will rapidly go from golden brown to burnt, so quickly transfer the chips to paper towels to drain. Lightly season with salt. The sunchoke chips can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for a day or two, or until they start to soften. (Makes about \u00bd cup.)\nUsing a sharp knife, cut the peel and pith off the orange. Working over a bowl, cut the orange between the membranes to release the segments. Dice the segments, then return them to the bowl.\nDrizzle the beet wedges with a little bit of olive oil, season with salt, and toss.\nSpread the ginger puree on the bottom of a shallow serving bowl or plate. Arrange the beets over the puree. Sprinkle the chopped orange segments over the beets and grind some pepper over the dish. Top with the cashews, herbs, and sunchoke chips. Serve.",

Transfer to a wire rack and cool in the pan to room temperature. Run a paring knife around the cake\u2019s edges and then place a serving platter larger than the diameter of the cake over the cake and gently flip the cake over\u2014it should slide out, with caramel coming out with it like you would see in a flan (though some caramel will be left in the pan\u2014this is fine).\nSlice and serve with freshly whipped cream or sliced almonds, if desired. The cake will keep in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.\nNote: To clean the pan, add some boiling water to the pan and let it sit for at least 30 minutes to loosen up the browned sugar sticking to the surface of the pan before cleaning it.",

Steps:In a medium saucepan, heat the milk to 195\u00b0F over medium heat. Using a wooden spoon, stir frequently during the heating process to prevent the milk from scalding. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the pan when you stir because this is where the milk is most prone to sticking. The milk will become foamy and bubbles will form on its surface once it reaches the desired temperature.\nRemove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice until evenly distributed, which will cause the separation of curds from the whey. The process should begin right away, but don\u2019t fret if it takes a minute or two. Cover the pan and set aside at room temperature for 10 minutes to let the acid work its magic. Check the mixture at this point: It should be slightly yellow and the curds should have completely separated from the whey. Don\u2019t panic if this hasn\u2019t happened completely yet. Simply add another teaspoon of acid and set aside for a few minutes more. This should do the trick.\nLine a fine-mesh sieve with cheesecloth and set the sieve over a bowl. Ladle the curds and whey into the sieve. Reserve the whey for another use. Season the curds (still in the sieve) with salt, stirring it in using a wooden spoon, then gather up the edges of the cheesecloth into a tight bundle and squeeze the excess whey from the curds. Place the cheesecloth and curds on a large plate and shape them into a square. Wrap the cheesecloth edges around the paneer and place a second plate on top of it to compress it. Set aside at room temperature for 30 minutes. At this point the paneer is ready to use or it can be refrigerated in a covered container for up to 3 days.",

Steps:Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F. Combine the carrot, tomatoes plus their juice, and 1 cup water in a blender. Blitz till it\u2019s as smooth as your blender allows.\nIn an ovenproof 12-inch saut\u00e9 pan or skillet set over medium heat, cook 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and the minced garlic. Watch for the garlic to start sizzling, then stir in the spinach and \u00bd teaspoon of the salt. Continue stirring for a minute, until all the spinach is wilted. Remove it from the pan and set aside.\nAdd the final tablespoon olive oil to the pan, raise the heat to medium, and add the turkey plus 1 teaspoon salt. Using a wooden spoon or spatula, break the turkey up into small morsels as it browns. When you have browned turkey, add the cumin, paprika, and black pepper. Stir to incorporate, toasting the spices for about 30 seconds.\nAdd the carrot-tomato mixture, the R-Rated Onions, vinegar, and \u00bd teaspoon salt. Let this cook for about 15 minutes, uncovered, stirring occasionally. You may need to lower the heat to prevent Joe from sticking or splattering. When the ragout is done it will be thick and juicy. If it seems too dry, stir in a little water. Taste the ragout for seasoning and adjust as you like.\nTurn the heat off and make four indentions in the ragout. Divide the spinach and put equal amounts in each indentation. Top each section of spinach with a cracked egg. Sprinkle the eggs with the remaining 1 teaspoon salt.\nSlide the skillet onto the middle rack of your preheated oven. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until the whites are set and the yolks are slightly runny.\nTo serve, scatter ribbons of Parmigiano Reggiano or another hard cheese over the top.

Ingredients:['4\u20135 large or 6\u20138 medium yellow or white onions', '1 Tbsp olive or vegetable oil', '1 tsp kosher salt']. Steps:Peel your onions and cut them in half through their stem ends\u2014longways, if you will. Slice them thinly with the grain, following the line from root to stem rather than cutting the onion across its belly. This is actually important because slicing it the other way makes the path to silky onions a longer one.\nOnce your onions are sliced, heat your skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil, then the onions and the salt. Let the onions sizzle for a couple minutes. Stir with a wooden spoon or a heatproof spatula and watch as they wilt for about 3 more minutes. At this point, reduce the heat to medium low. Put a lid on and step away for a few minutes. Give the onions a stir every now and then. You don\u2019t have to stand over it like risotto, but don\u2019t go for a walk around the block either. Caramelized bits will accumulate at the bottom and sides of the pan, and that\u2019s good. Just scrape them up and stir them in. A little color building as you go is okay, but don\u2019t rush to brown them. The point is to cook the onions gently, coaxing them through stages of raw, wilted, sweaty, soft, light brown, and finally deeply caramelized\nAbout 45 minutes in, remove the lid for the last time. They should be a light caramel color. Now, with the lid off, you will need to watch more closely and stir more frequently. At some point you may find that despite your best efforts some of the caramelized bits, verging on burnt, cling to the pan and threaten over all onion ruin. Do not fret! Just add a \u00bd cup or so of water and use its energy to help scrape up the stubborn but tasty film. Let the water cook out of course. When you\u2019re smiling over a soft, creamy, fragrant pile of mahogany onions, you\u2019re done.\nNote: R-Rated Onions will keep in the fridge for a week and in the freezer for 3 months.",

Steps:If using dried peas, soak them overnight in 3 cups of water. Drain. Bring 3 fresh cups of water to a boil in a saucepan and add the peas. Simmer for 15 minutes, or until cooked almost completely through. Drain and set aside. If using canned beans, drain, rinse with cold water, drain again, and set aside.

Remove bay leaf, thyme sprig, and hot pepper.\nNote: Pigeon peas are traditional in this dish, but pinto beans or black-eyes peas also work well because, like pigeon peas, they hold their shape well after cooking. Brown sugar is preferable for deeper flavor and color. Chicken is the most common meat in pelau, but cuts of stew beef or lamb work just as well. If using meat, up the cooking time before adding the rice to 40 minutes to allow the meat to get tender. In Tobago, pelau is often made with crab. West Indian pumpkin (also called calabaza) is ideal for this recipe, although the pie or \"cheese\" pumpkin common in the U.S., if in season, makes a very good substitute.

Decrease the speed to medium and beat in the eggs, one at a time, incorporating each one before adding the next. Mix just until the batter is smooth and uniform. Continuing to mix past that point, even though the batter won\u2019t look different, only incorporates extra air, which will cause the cheesecake to bubble excessively and the surface to crack as that air tries to escape during the baking process.\nDecrease the oven temperature to 350\u00b0F. Pour the batter into the prepared crust and tap the pan gently on the counter a few times to remove any large air bubbles. Place the springform pan in a large baking or roasting pan (just big enough for the springform pan to fit in) and set the pan on the middle rack in the oven. Fill the pan with enough hot water to reach the rim of the springform pan. Bake for about 1 hour, or until the sides of the custard are set and the middle is still just slightly wobbly. Generally, if the entirety of the custard is fully set, your cheesecake is overbaked. Don\u2019t panic\u2014it\u2019ll still be delicious, and you\u2019ll do better next time!\nLet the cheesecake cool in the water until it is about room temperature. (You don\u2019t want to have to try to grab the pan out of hot water if you can help it.) However, if you\u2019re worried that your cheesecake might be slightly overbaked, you\u2019ll want to pull it out rather quickly, and let it cool at room temperature. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours before slicing. The cake can be refrigerated, covered, for up to 4 days.\nIn a large heavy-bottomed saut\u00e9 pan, heat the butter until melted. Stir in the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and honey and let cook until bubbling. Add the apples and toss to coat. Stir in the lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, cinnamon, cardamom, and ginger; stir to combine. Cook for about 4 minutes, or until the apples just start to soften. Remove from the heat, stir in the vanilla, and transfer to a bowl to cool completely before use. The filling can be made up to 3 days ahead of time and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator.",

Ingredients:['2\u00bc tsp. nonfat dry milk powder', '2 tsp. baking powder', '2 tsp. granulated sugar or light brown sugar', '2 cups (240 g) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting', '1 Tbsp. vegetable oil, plus more', '2 Tbsp. vegetable shortening, room temperature', '1 Tbsp. ghee', 'unsalted butter', 'or vegan butter', 'room temperature']. Steps:Whisk milk powder, baking powder, granulated sugar, and 2 cups (240 g) flour in a large shallow bowl. Add about a fourth of \u00be cup warm water (110\u00b0) and mix in a wide circular motion with your fingers to gently combine (do not knead). As mixture becomes dry, add more of the water, little by little, and keep mixing gently until a shaggy dough forms; it should be soft and sticky, without dry spots. (Depending on the humidity, you may not need all of the water.)\nDrizzle 1 Tbsp. oil over dough and gently press with your knuckles so that the top of dough is covered with oil. Cover bowl with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rest in a warm spot 15 minutes.\nMeanwhile, mix shortening and ghee in a small bowl until smooth.\nTurn out dough onto a lightly floured surface. Flour your hands and gently fold dough over on itself once or twice, then roll into a fat cylinder. Working quickly, without handling the dough too much, divide dough into four equal pieces and gently form each piece into a ball. Cover balls with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rest 10 minutes.\nRoll out a dough ball on a lightly floured surface into a 5-6\"\u2013diameter round. Brush with a quarter of shortening mixture and sprinkle evenly with flour. Cut a slit halfway across the dough, from the center to the edge. Starting on one side of slit, fold cut edge of dough at about a \u00be\" interval. Continue folding process until you reach the other side of the slit and have formed a cone. Pinch together edges at wide end of cone to seal, then bring both point ends together at the top and gently push in toward center of cone to create a dimple (you don\u2019t need to push in too far). Push point at narrow end of cone in toward the center. You should now have a ball with a dimple on each end. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and repeat with remaining balls of dough. Cover balls with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rest 20 minutes.\nHeat a tawa or griddle over medium until a drop of water immediately sizzles on surface, about 2 minutes.\nMeanwhile, place a ball of dough on a dimpled side on a lightly floured surface. Gently flatten into a round with your hands, turning once if desired, then roll, rotating often, to a \u215b\"-thick round, about 10\u201312\".\nBrush tawa with a thin layer of oil. Cook roti until it begins to bubble slightly across the surface, about 20 seconds. Brush surface of roti with oil and continue to cook until bubbles across surface increase and roti is stiff enough on bottom side to turn, about 1 minute more. Turn roti over and brush surface with oil (bubbles may deflate; that\u2019s okay). Using a spatula, move roti around to avoid hot spots and ensure even cooking, pressing on edges and uncooked spots to increase contact with pan. Continue to cook, turning every 30 seconds or so, until cooked through and both sides are speckled with golden brown spots, 1\u20132 minutes more. Using 2 spatulas, push opposite edges of roti toward the center. Smack down on the bunched roti with the ends of the spatulas to break up and flake, then turn roti over. Repeat process, scrunching and smacking roti from different directions, until flaky and lightly shredded. Transfer to a clean kitchen towel set inside a bowl or basket and wrap up to keep warm. Repeat with remaining dough balls and more oil, adding finished roti to bowl and covering tightly with towel as you go.",

Ingredients:['1\u00bd cups warm water', '1 teaspoon instant yeast', '4\u00bd cups (540 grams) bread flour, divided, plus more as needed', '2 tablespoons canola oil, plus more for your bowl', '3\u00bd teaspoons Morton kosher salt']. Steps:Combine the water and yeast in a large mixing bowl (if you have a stand mixer, use that bowl) and let sit for 5 minutes.\nReserve \u00bd cup (60 grams) bread flour and add the remaining 4 cups to the mixing bowl along with the canola oil.\nIf you have a stand mixer, fit it with the dough hook and knead the mixture on low speed for about 3 minutes, until a sticky but cohesive dough starts to form. Pause occasionally to scrape down the bowl if the flour is clinging to the sides and bottom or climbing up the hook. If you\u2019re making the dough without a stand mixer, mix it with a wooden spoon. In either case, loosely cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a dish towel and let rest for 30 minutes.\nWith your stand mixer on low or while stirring by hand in the mixing bowl, add the salt and, over the course of 2 or 3 minutes, add the remaining \u00bd cup flour, 2 tablespoons at a time. The dough should be more tense; it will feel soft but tacky, although it will pull from the sides of the bowl.\nFlour your hands generously and use them to pull the dough onto a clean, unfloured work surface. Cup your hands around the dough, rolling it in short, circular strokes and using the sides of your hands to nudge it into a relatively smooth ball.\nLightly wipe the inside of a large bowl with canola oil and place the dough inside, flipping it once or twice to coat. Loosely cover the bowl and let the dough rise at a warm room temperature for 1 hour.\nAfter 1 hour, the dough will be stretchy but very soft. Leaving it inside the bowl, stretch opposite sides of the dough over the center. Rotate the bowl a quarter- turn and stretch the dough in the same way, then flip the whole mound of dough upside down and cover again. Let rise for 1 hour.\nRepeat this series of folds one more time, allow it to rise at room temperature for 1 hour, then tightly cover the bowl and refrigerate overnight or up to 2 days. The longer the dough is refrigerated, the more flavor it will have. After this rise, it\u2019s ready to be shaped; bear in mind that, once it\u2019s shaped, it will need more time for a final rise, so plan ahead.\nWipe a bit of canola oil on a large baking sheet. Dump the dough onto a clean, dry counter, and use a bench scraper or sharp knife to cut it into eight equal pieces; make clean, decisive cuts rather than use a sawing motion, so you don\u2019t deflate all the air inside.\nLightly flour your hands and place one palm directly over the dough ball, with all your fingertips touching the counter to make a sort of \u201ccage\u201d around the dough. Roll it in brisk, small circles on the countertop so it tightens itself into a smoother, more taut ball.\nSpace the rounds of dough a few inches apart, seam side down, on the sheet, and roll to coat them lightly in oil. Tightly cover the sheet with plastic wrap so the dough doesn\u2019t dry out, and let them rise at room temperature for 2 to 4 more hours, until they\u2019re pillowy.\nMeanwhile, set a baking stone on the center rack of your oven and turn on the broiler. You\u2019re emulating a 700\u00b0F wood- burning oven, so you need to give the stone a good long while to preheat before you bake.\nWhen the dough is ready, lightly flour a work surface, and use a bench scraper or thin metal spatula to coax one piece into your palm; be sure you don\u2019t manhandle it or you\u2019ll force out the pockets of air that formed while it rose. Dust a little more flour on the top of the dough and onto your rolling pin.\nWith firm, even pressure, briskly roll the dough a few times along its length. Flip it upside down, rotate it a quarter- turn, and roll it the same way, keeping it as round as possible. Repeat, dusting a little extra flour as needed, until it\u2019s about 6 inches across.\nThis next part happens fast and furiously, so make sure you have no distractions\u2014screaming children and natural disasters will have to wait. Use tongs or a good oven mitt to pull the oven rack with the baking stone partially out. Carefully pick up the pita, drape it over your palm, and slap it down onto the stone as if you\u2019re giving it a high- five (just be careful not to touch the hot stone!). Set a timer for 1 minute, and close the oven. Broilers vary in strength but all are quite hot, so don\u2019t turn your back on the oven or the pita may burn. Check on it\u2014 it should puff up and build in color, with some beautiful blistered spots. If it\u2019s still pale, close the oven and let it keep baking for 30- second intervals.\nUse tongs to flip the pita, and let it finish baking with the oven door cracked so you can watch it finish. Pull it out when the second side is as pretty as the first; this can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes, depending on your broiler.\nBake off the rest of the dough this way; as you get the hang of it, feel free to bake two pitas at a time. Serve these hot or at room temperature.",

(If it seems like the liquid is evaporating too quickly, you may need to cover the pot partially with an offset lid.) The beets should be extremely soft and the liquid bright red.\nStrain the liquid, pressing the cooked beets against the side of the strainer to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the pulp or reserve. Set aside the beet water. You should have just about 4 cups.\nMeanwhile, place the remaining 1 pound of whole beets in a separate large stockpot. Add water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the beets are tender-firm, about 40 minutes. When the beets are cooked, add 1 tablespoon white vinegar and set them aside to cool.\nWhen the whole cooked beets are cool enough to handle, peel them; the skins should slip off easily. Grate the peeled beets on the largest holes of a box grater or in a food processor fitted with the grating blade.\nTo make the broth, place the pork butt in a large stockpot and add the beef stock. If necessary, add a little more stock or water to cover. Add the bay leaf, allspice berries, and peppercorns. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the meat is tender and beginning to fall apart, about 2 hours. Set the pork aside to cool. When the pork is cool enough to handle, remove it from the pot and cut the meat into \u00bd-inch cubes. Strain the broth and discard the bay leaf, allspice berries, and peppercorns. Reserve the cubed meat and 4 cups of the broth.\nTo cook the vegetables, place the carrots and celery in a large stockpot and pour the reserved meat broth over them. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until the carrots and celery are just tender, about 8 minutes. Add the cabbage and potatoes and continue to cook until the potatoes and carrots are easily pierced with a pairing knife but keep their shape, 15 to 20 additional minutes. Add the lima beans and cook for 5 additional minutes, just to meld the flavors. Gradually add the remaining 7 tablespoons white vinegar, tasting between additions and stopping when the flavor is to your liking. Remove the soup from the heat and set aside.\nTo compose the soup, in a large soup pot combine the \u201cbeet water\u201d and meat broth with the vegetables. Add the cubed pork and the grated beets. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer over low heat. Season to taste with salt and serve immediately.",

Steps:Using a sharp chef\u2019s knife, score skin of each fish fillet in a crosshatch pattern, making cuts about \u00bd\" apart. Season fillets on both sides with salt and alligator pepper.\nToast cubeb peppers in a dry small skillet over medium-low heat, shaking occasionally, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a spice mill or mortar and pestle. Let cool and coarsely grind; set aside. Coarsely chop half of papaya into 1\" pieces; set remaining half aside. Coarsely chop half of cilantro (leaves and stems); set remaining cilantro aside.\nTransfer chopped papaya to a blender; add oil and blend, adding 1\u20132 Tbsp. water to get it going if needed, until smooth. Add chopped cilantro, onion, garlic, ginger, ground chile, \u00bc tsp. salt, and reserved ground cubeb pepper. Blend mixture to a smooth paste.\nCoat fillets all over with marinade, rubbing into score marks. Place fish, skin side down, in a single layer in a large baking dish. Squeeze juice from half a lemon over. Set remaining lemon half aside for serving. Cover with plastic wrap or a lid and chill at least 2 hours and up to 12 hours.\nFill a large bowl with water. Peel yams and slice in half lengthwise, then slice in half crosswise. Cut each quarter into \u00bd\"-thick slabs. (Length of slabs will depend on yam\u2019s size, but you\u2019re going for something that looks like steak fries.) Add yam slices to bowl as you work to prevent oxidation. When all yams are cut, swish in water to remove excess starch, then drain. Refill bowl and repeat process until water is clear, about 2 more times. Add sugar and \u00bd tsp. salt and stir until dissolved; add the drained chips. (Yams, like many foods that are good for you, can be quite bitter; the sugar will help counter this.) Let soak 30 minutes.\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 450\u00b0. Drain chips and pat dry with a clean kitchen towel. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with 2 Tbsp. oil. Season with black pepper, then sprinkle with chili powder and remaining 1 tsp. salt. Toss to coat, then spread out into an even layer. Roast chips, turning halfway through, until golden brown and crisp, about 20 minutes.\nHeat broiler. Scrape off excess marinade from fish and place fillets, skin side up, on another rimmed baking sheet. Broil until browned and crisp on top and cooked through, 5\u20137 minutes.\nUsing a vegetable peeler, shave reserved papaya into ribbons, pick leaves from reserved cilantro stems, and cut reserved lemon half into wedges.\nTransfer fish to plates and top with papaya and cilantro. Mound yam chips next to fillets. Serve with shito and lemon wedges alongside.",

Steps:Place apricots in a small bowl and pour in hot water to cover. Let sit 20 minutes, then drain and coarsely chop. Return apricots to same bowl and add rum; stir to coat. Chill at least 30 minutes and up to 1 day. Drain into a mesh sieve set over another small bowl or container. Reserve apricots and rum separately.\nMelt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add cinnamon, 3 Tbsp. coconut sugar, and reserved apricots. Cook, stirring occasionally, until apricots are slightly softened and coated in caramel, 6\u20138 minutes. Add reserved rum and cook, stirring often, until thickened and syrupy, about 5 minutes. Let cool slightly. (Just FYI: You can eat these drunk apricots right away over vanilla ice cream and be very happy.)\nToast grains of selim pods and cubeb peppers in a small skillet over medium-low heat, shaking occasionally, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a spice mill or mortar and pestle and let cool. Grind as well as you can. The grains of selim won\u2019t completely break up, so cracked open but mostly whole is okay\u2014you just want to release some of their flavor.\nHeat oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Cook white and red onions, stirring occasionally, until softened and just starting brown, 20\u201325 minutes. Stir in ground grains of selim and cubeb pepper, garlic, ginger, and remaining 1 tsp. coconut sugar. Cook, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Add red pepper flakes, rosemary, thyme, prawn powder, and 1 tsp. salt to pot and cook, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes. Add drunk apricots along with any syrup and cook, stirring often, about 2 minutes.\nAdd tomato pur\u00e9e to pot and cook, stirring occasionally, 4 minutes, then stir in chile powder. Add broth and fresh chile. Cover pot and cook, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until a loose dark brown paste forms, 30\u201340 minutes. The oil will rise to the surface when the sauce is ready. Remove from heat; taste and season with more salt if needed. If you like texture, leave as is, or blend with an immersion blender (or let it cool slightly and blend it in a blender) to make it smooth. Let cool completely.\nSpoon shito into jars or an airtight container with at least a \u00bc\" layer of oil on top.\nDo ahead: Shito can made 1 week ahead. Cover and chill.\nNote: The amount of chile described in this recipe is what I would classify as pretty hot\u2014some West Africans might call this medium hot, some very hot. Folks familiar with heat will enjoy this, but if you don\u2019t like super-jacked heat you should probably err on the lower end of the range.

        "content": "We will be making Summer Bean Soup With Tomato Brown Butter, here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['8 oz. (230 g) dried beans, such as flageolet or navy, or fresh shelling beans', '2 in. square dried kombu', '2 large tomatoes', '2 celery ribs', '1 carrot', '1 leek, white and light green parts only', '6 shallots, skins intact', '6 garlic cloves, minced', '4 oil-packed anchovy fillets', '6 Tbsp. (90 ml) extra-virgin olive oil', '2 Tbsp. maple syrup', '1 \u00bd Tbsp. kosher salt', '1 Tbsp. red pepper flakes', '1 tsp. whole-grain mustard', '8 oz. (230 g) bacon', '8 oz. (230 g) Romano beans or green beans, chopped into 1 in. pieces', '2 shallots, thinly sliced', '1 tsp. red pepper flakes', 'Zest and juice of 1 lemon', '1 garlic clove, grated', '12 pickled green beans (see Basic Wet Salt Method, below)', '9 cherry tomatoes, quartered', '2 tsp. extra-virgin olive oil', '1 tsp. sherry vinegar', 'Tomato Brown Butter', 'Crumbled feta', 'parsley leaves', 'and marjoram leaves for garnish']. Steps:Combine the dried beans and kombu in a large container and cover with plenty of water to soak for at least 4 hours or overnight; skip this step if using fresh beans.\nDrain the beans and kombu and add them to a large pot with enough water to cover by about 1 in. (if using fresh beans, add the kombu now). Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; meanwhile, halve the tomatoes and cut the celery, carrot, and leek into about 3 in. pieces. As soon as the water boils, decrease the heat to medium-low and add the vegetables to the pot, along with the whole shallots and minced garlic. Continue to cook at a gentle simmer until the beans are very creamy, 60 to 90 minutes for dried beans and about half that for fresh.\nRemove the pot from the heat and use a slotted spoon to reserve the tomatoes; remove and discard the other vegetables.\nSet up a sieve over a heat proof container and strain the beans (there should be about 3 cups or 480 g), reserving all the cooking liquid.\nIn a blender, combine 1 cup (160 g) of the cooked beans with 2 cups (480 ml) of the cooking liquid, plus the tomatoes, anchovies, oil, maple syrup, salt, red pepper flakes, and mustard. Pur\u00e9e until extremely smooth, pour into a large bowl, and fold in the reserved cooked beans by hand. At this point, you can serve it right away or transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days, gently rewarming over medium-low heat when you\u2019re ready to serve.\nWhile the bean soup is cooking, preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F. Cut the bacon into \u00bc in. lardons; reserve 3 whole beans for garnish and cut the rest into 2 to 3 in. pieces.\nIn a medium saucepan or Dutch oven, spread the bacon in an even layer and cook over medium-low heat until it starts to turn golden and crisp, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the pieces but leave the fat behind.\nIncrease the heat slightly, and saut\u00e9 the shallots until translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in the chopped beans, bacon, and red pepper flakes. Cover with a lid or a tight layer of foil and bake until the beans are very soft, 60 to 90 minutes. Stir in the lemon zest, juice, and garlic as soon as the beans come out of the oven and cover again; the residual steam will cook the garlic.\nThinly slice the pickled green beans on the bias. Combine with the cherry tomatoes, oil, and vinegar.\nTo serve, ladle the bean soup into bowls with a big spoonful of the baked beans on top. Garnish with the pickled green bean mix, a swirl of tomato brown butter, crumbled feta, and torn fresh herbs. Leftovers can all be refrigerated in separate airtight containers, though the green bean salad is best on the day it\u2019s made, when the beans are most crisp and the tomatoes are fresh.\nThis works for any amount of dense vegetables or dense, underripe fruit, either whole or cut up, such as carrots, turnips, beets, winter squash, onions, green beans, Brussels sprouts, green tomatoes, small apples, underripe peaches, and whole baby cabbages. Peel off any tough skins, such as on beets, winter squash, and onions, and trim the tops. Leave the vegetables whole or cut them into the desired finished shape. Place the vegetables in a nonreactive container and pour water to completely submerge them; as you do so, keep track of how much water you\u2019re adding since the amount of water will dictate the amount of salt (generally 3.5 percent salt by weight of the water for most vegetables, although cucumbers can handle 4 to 5 percent and the increased salt assists with keeping their texture crispy). With a long wooden spoon, stir kosher salt into the brine (or add the salt, cap the jar, and give it a hearty shake) until the salt is dissolved. Place a weight on top of the vegetables to keep them submerged in the brine. Seal the container, using a lid with an airlock if you have one. If you don\u2019t have an airlock, you\u2019ll just need to open the container every few days or so to release carbon dioxide buildup and check for mold. Place the container in a clean, low-light area with an ambient temperature of 60\u00b0F to 68\u00b0F until the pickles taste sour, about 3 weeks. Refrigerate indefinitely.",

Place quarters cut side down and slice in half lengthwise again to create 8 pieces total per cucumber. Add to bowl with reserved chicken.\nSet 1 Tbsp. sesame seeds aside in a small bowl for serving. Crush remaining sesame seeds in a mortar and pestle until some of the seeds have turned to powder, but with plenty of whole seeds left. (Alternatively, you can pulse seeds a few times in a food processor or spice mill, then transfer to a medium bowl before proceeding). Add lime juice, tahini, soy sauce, honey, and red pepper flakes and mash to create a paste. Add \u00bc cup water and whisk to combine (if you don\u2019t have a small enough whisk, work in with the pestle). Taste and season with salt.\nAdd lettuce and cilantro to bowl with reserved scallions. Pour half of dressing over and toss to coat. Arrange on a platter. Pour remaining dressing over chicken and cucumbers, toss to coat, and arrange over greens. Top salad with reserved 1 Tbsp. sesame seeds and squeeze juice from lime half over.",

Ingredients:['Softened butter (for the pan)', '8 whole graham crackers (120 g)', '11 digestive biscuits or 4 additional graham crackers (60 g)', '2 (14 oz/397 g) cans sweetened condensed milk', '3 Hass avocados', '1 pound (455 g) cream cheese, at room temperature', 'Pinch fine sea salt', '2 lemons', '2 limes']. Steps:Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Lightly butter the inside of a 9-inch (23-cm) springform pan.\nMake the crust: Crumble the crackers and cookies into a medium bowl. Use a pestle or the bottom of a heavy bottle to crush them into fine crumbs. Add \u2153 cup (75 ml) of the condensed milk and stir until very well combined. (You can grind the crumbled graham crackers and mix them with the condensed milk in a food processor if you prefer.) Press the crumb mixture firmly and evenly into the bottom of the pan. Bake until the crust looks a little darker and smells sweet and toasty, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool the crust in the pan on a wire rack.\nOne at a time, cut an avocado in half lengthwise. Twist the halves to separate them. Hold the half with the pit in one hand. Holding the knife in your other hand, rap the knife blade into the pit to lodge it there. Twist the knife to loosen and remove the pit. Use a large spoon to scoop the avocado flesh onto a chopping board, discarding the skins. Coarsely chop the avocados.\nAdd the chopped avocados, cream cheese, remaining condensed milk, and salt to a food processor. (You can combine the filling in a blender instead but you may need to work in batches.) Grate the zest of 1 lemon and set aside. Squeeze the zested lemon and the limes (you should have about \u2153 cup/75 ml lemon), reserving the remaining lemon for garnish. Add the juice to the avocados and process the mixture until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.\nSpread the filling in the cooled crust and sprinkle with the grated lemon zest. Cover the pan and freeze until the filling is firm, at least 6 hours or preferably overnight.\nLet the frozen cake stand at room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes before slicing. Dipping a thin knife into hot water between each cut, slice the cake into wedges and serve, topping each serving with freshly grated lemon zest.",

Steps:Add the hazelnuts to a small skillet over medium heat. Toast them slowly, shaking the pan often, until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove them from the skillet, and when they are cool enough to handle, roughly chop the nuts.\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta until al dente. Drain it, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid and add it to a large bowl.\nIn a large skillet, heat the butter over medium-low heat. Once the butter begins to foam, add the garlic and use a wooden spoon to stir the mixture constantly until the butter begins to brown and have a slight nutty aroma, about 5 minutes. Add the salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Give the mixture a good stir, and then set it aside to infuse for about 5 minutes longer away from the heat.\nPour the butter mixture (scraping the garlic, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes) all over the warm pasta. If the pasta feels a bit dry, add a touch of the reserved cooking liquid. Toss to combine and set aside.\nSet the same skillet (without cleaning it) over medium-high heat.

Add the Parmesan shavings and the balsamic vinegar (if you\u2019re using it); toss. Taste for seasonings and add more salt and pepper if needed.\nServe warm or at room temperature.\nLocalize it: You can use kale instead of chard, and any nut will work in place of the hazelnuts.

Steps:Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.\nIn a large, wide bowl, combine the flour, salt, and parsley. Add the butter pieces and, using a pastry blender or your fingertips, cut them up and into the flour mixture until it resembles little pebbles. Keep breaking up the bits of butter until the texture is very coarse.\nIn a small dish, whisk together the sour cream, vinegar, and water, and combine it with the butter-flour mixture. Using a spatula or wooden spoon, stir the wet and the dry together until a shaggy dough forms. If needed, get your hands into the bowl to knead it a few times into one big ball. Pat the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic, and chill it in the fridge for 1 hour or up to 2 days.\nIn a large skillet over medium, heat 1 tablespoon of the cooking fat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until golden, about 15 minutes. Let cool.\nMeanwhile, thinly slice the tomatoes; toss them with 1 teaspoon salt and let them drain in a colander for 30 minutes, tossing them occasionally.\nIn a bowl, combine the cheeses, mayo, 2 tablespoons each of the chopped basil and parsley, the thyme, a hefty pinch each of salt and pepper, and the saut\u00e9ed onion.\nSprinkle a little flour in the bottom of a 10-inch well-seasoned cast-iron skillet. Set it aside.\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 13-inch circle. Fit it into the prepared skillet, allowing the edges to extend over the sides of the pan.\nSpread the cheese mixture evenly over the bottom of the dough. Arrange the tomatoes on top. Gently fold the overhanging pie crust over the tomatoes. It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect.\nDrizzle the pie with the remaining 1 tablespoon cooking fat and season with pepper. In a small bowl, whisk together the beaten egg and milk. Brush the crust with this egg wash, place the cast-iron pan on a rimmed baking sheet (to protect the bottom of your oven from any overflowing filling), and bake the pie until the tomatoes are browned, 50 to 60 minutes. Top the pie with the remaining 1 tablespoon each basil and parsley.\nLocalize it: Swap out any of the herbs or cheeses. The Manchego in this recipe is salty, and the mozzarella melts really well, so just keep that in mind when you\u2019re doing your swaps.",

Remove escab\u00e8che from heat and stir in oregano.\nHeat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in reserved skillet over high. Arrange pork chops in pan so bone ends are in the center (this part cooks slower and this will help with even browning) and press down on pork chops with tongs to ensure surface is making good contact with the pan. Cook until golden underneath, about 3 minutes. Turn pork chops over and press down on them again. Transfer to oven and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 130\u00b0 for medium (you should still have a little pink flesh; temperature should rise to about 145\u00b0 when the pork chops rest), 5\u20137 minutes. Transfer pork chops to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes.\nTo serve, transfer pork chops to plates and spoon escab\u00e8che over.\nDo ahead: Escab\u00e8che can be made 2 weeks ahead.

Steps:Spatchcock chicken the Thai way by placing it breast side up on a large cutting board. Using a sharp, heavy knife and working just to the side of the center of the breast, cut down through to the breastbone (do not cut all the way through to the backbone). Now that the path has been created, use the same knife\u2014or, easier, a sturdy pair of kitchen scissors\u2014to make a clean cut all the way through the breastbone and anything else that is still connecting the 2 sides of the breast together. Open up chicken and turn skin side up. Press down on chicken to flatten. Pat thoroughly dry.\nGrind peppercorns in a spice mill or a mortar and pestle. Transfer to a food processor or leave in mortar and pestle and add garlic, cilantro roots, brown sugar, fish sauce, turmeric, salt, coriander, cumin, and cardamom and process or pound until smooth. Coat chicken completely in marinade, pressing to adhere and working into nooks and crannies. Place in a large bowl and cover with a plate. Let chill at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours.\nLet chicken sit at room temperature 1 hour before grilling or baking.\nPur\u00e9e pineapple and vinegar in a food processor or blender until smooth. Transfer to a small saucepan and add garlic, jalape\u00f1os, granulated sugar, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then reduce heat so sauce is at a simmer and cook until thick and smooth (consistency should be similar to cocktail sauce), about 5 minutes.\nGrind saffron to a fine powder in a spice mill or a mortar and pestle. Transfer to a small saucepan and add granulated sugar, salt, and \u00bc cup water and cook over medium heat just until heated through and small bubbles appear around the edges of the pan. Whisk in coconut oil and remove from heat.\nIf using a grill, prepare a grill for medium-high indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill; for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off); oil grate. Arrange chicken, skin side up, on cooler part of grill. Close lid and grill, rotating chicken but keeping skin side up every 5\u201310 minutes, until skin looks dry and golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast and thighs registers 130\u00b0\u2013140\u00b0, 35\u201340 minutes. If using charcoal and your coals are dying, start a new chimney of coals 15 minutes before this point so you are ready for the next step.\nUncover grill and increase heat to high (add more coals for a charcoal grill). Brush one fourth of basting liquid over skin and turn chicken over, positioning over direct heat on the hot side of the grill. Grill, brushing half of remaining basting liquid over bone side of chicken, until skin is browned and lightly charred in spots, about 3 minutes. (Watch carefully as this can happen quickly.) Turn chicken over and return to cooler side of grill. Brush skin with remaining basting liquid. Cover grill and continue to grill chicken until thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast registers 160\u00b0 and thickest part of thighs registers 165\u00b0, 10\u201315 minutes longer.\nIf using an oven, place a rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 350\u00b0. Place chicken, skin side up, on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Brush one third of basting liquid over skin. Bake, rotating baking sheet every 10 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast and thighs registers 130\u00b0\u2013140\u00b0, 35\u201340 minutes.\nIncrease oven temperature to 450\u00b0. Brush remaining basting liquid over skin and continue to bake, rotating baking sheet halfway through, until skin is crisp and charred and thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast registers 160\u00b0 and thickest part of thighs registers 165\u00b0, 10\u201315 minutes longer.\nTransfer chicken to a cutting board and let rest at least 15 minutes. Carve up further as desired.\nTop dipping sauce with cilantro. Serve chicken with rice and dipping sauce alongside.\nIf you cook the chicken in the oven, using the dhungar method to perfume the finished chicken with the scent of smoky ghee is highly recommended.",

Ingredients:['1 gallon cold water', '1 (6-inch) square dashima (kombu)', '3 medium dried shiitake mushrooms', '12 large dried anchovies (gutted and heads removed)']. Steps:Put the water, dashima, shiitake mushrooms, and anchovies in a covered stockpot or other large pot and let stand at room temperature overnight, or for 8 to 12 hours.\nRemove the lid, set the pot over high heat, and heat until the surface of the water begins to ripple; pay attention, and do not let it come to a boil. Lower the heat to maintain a very gentle simmer (the ideal temperature is a few degrees below a light boil) and simmer for 80 to 90 minutes. Taste the dashi every 20 minutes to monitor the changes in flavor and texture. You will notice the texture becoming softer. I describe it as having a slippery, slightly viscous texture compared to tap water. The sea flavor will become stronger, and the dashi will become darker, like pale Earl Grey tea. The sweetness will take a while to appear, but when it does, the dashi is almost ready. When you can taste the sweetness and deep sea flavors, and the dashi has a very soft texture, it is done. Be vigilant, because dashi will become bitter if cooked too long.\nStrain the dashi into a covered container and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. After 24 hours, the dashi will begin to lose some of its flavor and it will turn slightly flat.\nIt\u2019s best to use dashi the same day you make it, though if you keep it refrigerated, you can use it for another day or two. By the third day, it will no longer taste fresh.\nVegetarians can make a dashi from just dashima and dried shiitakes.",

Steps:Bring 1\u00bd cups (360 ml) of the water to a boil. Put the tamarind pulp in a heat-proof nonreactive bowl, and cover with the boiling water. Cover and let sit for about 1 hour, until the pulp has become soft and mushy. Using a small potato masher or clean hands, massage and squeeze the block to soften the pulp. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer suspended over a medium bowl, pressing the pulp through the strainer with a large spoon. Discard the seeds and other solids left behind. Refrigerate the tamarind extract in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to use, for up to 4 days.\nRinse the ginger and gently scrub to remove any traces of dirt. If the ginger is young, with a thin skin, leave the skin on. Otherwise, peel. Cut into thin slices. In a medium saucepan, combine the ginger, sugar, and remaining 1 cup (240 ml) water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and immediately remove the saucepan from the heat. Cover and steep for 10 minutes. Strain the ginger simple syrup through a fine-mesh strainer and discard the ginger.\nIn a large pitcher, mix the tamarind extract and the ginger simple syrup together. Fill eight tall glasses with ice. Pour 4 oz (120 ml) of the tamarind-ginger syrup into each glass, top with 4 oz (120 ml) of the club soda or chilled water, and stir. Store any remaining tamarind-ginger syrup in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.\nThis rejuvenating drink combines the mild heat of young ginger and the sourness of tamarind. It\u2019s wonderful during the warmer months. Young ginger requires no peeling before use because its outer skin is so thin. I recommend using South Asian tamarind, which is a lot more sour than the Mexican variety. Look for it in Asian and Indian markets.",

Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.\nSumac is rich in citric, malic, and tartaric acids but also bitter tannins. Steeping it in water dissolves the water-soluble acids. Gallotannin, one of the main tannins present in sumac, is bitter to taste and dissolves in water easily. Avoid steeping the sumac for too long or its tannins will make the syrup bitter. Saffron is ground to a fine powder using a little sugar as an abrasive. Grinding saffron increases the amount of color and flavor extracted than would be achieved if the strands were used directly. Club soda if used, adds a second note of acidity from the carbonic acid as well as the crackling sound of bubbles that create a sensation via chemesthesis.",

Steps:Warm 3 teaspoons of the oil in a frying pan over medium-low heat. Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes, stirring gently. Add the garlic and continue to cook for 3 minutes. (If, at any time during the cooking process, the items in the pan dry out at all, deglaze the pan with some lime juice, scraping up the browned bits with a wooden spoon, and continue.)

Interleaved with finishing the rest of the recipe, heat each tortilla in the oil-coated pan for about 20 seconds per side, just long enough to make them the slightest bit golden but still pliable, and put between two towels to stay warm and wick away any excess oil.\nOnce the chiles have cooked for 10 minutes, pour the lime juice on the ingredients in the pan. Add the diced bacon to the pan and turn the heat to medium-high. When the pan has heated up and the bacon has started to turn color, add the shrimp and use the salt to season everything in the pan. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring and flipping the shrimp as necessary to cook them evenly. The shrimp should be bright pink and white and opaque. If they are still translucent, cook them a little longer.\nSprinkle the cheese over everything in the pan and turn the heat to low. Continue stirring until the cheese is melted. Remove the pan from the heat. Distribute the cheesy shrimp mixture equally among the tortillas, making a plate full of tacos. Serve along with the lime wedges and red salsa, if desired.",

        "content": "We will be making Salted PB&J; Ice Cream Pie, here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['1 sleeve (110 g) Ritz crackers or other cracker of your choice', '\u2153 cup (45 g) raw peanuts or other nut or seed, finely chopped', '\u2153 cup (67 g; packed) light or dark brown sugar', '\u00bd tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bc tsp. Morton kosher salt', '6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted', '3 large eggs', '\u00bd cup (100 g; packed) light or dark brown sugar', '\u00bd tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bc tsp. Morton kosher salt', '1 tsp. vanilla extract', '\u00bd cup (128 g) natural peanut butter or other natural nut or seed butter', '1\u00bd cups heavy cream', '\u2153 cup (100 g) grape jelly (preferably Bonne Maman) or other jelly', 'jam', 'or compote']. Steps:Preheat oven to 275\u00b0F. Place crackers in a deep pie dish (a shallower one will work but you may have some filling left over) and gently crush with your hands until you have a mix of dime-size pieces, small crumbs, and everything in between. Add peanuts, brown sugar, and salt and toss to combine. Drizzle in butter and toss to evenly coat. Using your hands and the bottom of a measuring cup, press firmly and evenly into bottom and up sides of dish. (Mixture will look and feel crumbly, but it will hold together when baked.) Bake crust until a shade darker, 20\u201325 minutes. Let cool.\nDo Ahead: Crust can be baked 3 days ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature, or freeze up to 1 month.\nPour water into a medium saucepan to come 1\u00bd\" up the sides and bring to a bare simmer over medium-low heat. Whisk eggs, brown sugar, and salt in a large heatproof bowl just to combine (or use the bowl of a stand mixer if you\u2019ve got one). Set over saucepan (bowl should not touch water) and heat egg mixture, stirring constantly with a heatproof rubber spatula, until sugar dissolves, about 4 minutes (mixture will no longer feel gritty when rubbed between your fingers). If you are concerned about undercooked eggs, heat mixture longer, still stirring constantly, until an instant-read thermometer registers 165\u00b0F, about 3 minutes more. Remove bowl from heat and add vanilla to egg mixture. Using an electric mixer, beat on high speed until thick and pale and doubled in volume, about 10 minutes. (Or, if using a stand mixer, beat with the whisk attachment, 6\u20138 minutes.)\nUsing spatula, mix peanut butter in another large bowl to loosen up and smooth out. Stir one third of egg mixture into peanut butter to lighten, then gently fold in half of remaining egg mixture, running spatula down sides and along bottom of bowl, then lifting up through center and over top while rotating bowl, until just combined. Repeat with remaining egg mixture (it will lose a lot of volume, and that\u2019s okay).\nStarting on low speed and gradually increasing to medium-high, beat cream in the same bowl you used for egg mixture (no need to wash) until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes. Gently fold into peanut butter mixture and scrape into crust. Dollop jelly all over; swirl with a butter knife. (For more defined swirls, freeze pie 30 minutes before adding jelly.) Freeze at least 8 hours before serving.\nTo slice, run a chef\u2019s knife under hot water to warm up the blade, then wipe to clean and dry between slices. Use an offset spatula or fork to loosen slices from dish. If pie is frozen very hard, you may need to let it temper in the fridge 30 minutes before serving.\nDo Ahead: Pie can be made 2 weeks ahead. Wrap tightly and freeze.",

Ingredients:['2\u00bd tbsp olive oil', '2 onions, finely diced (2\u00bd cups/350g)', '4 cups/1kg tomato puree', '12\u00bc oz/350g ripe tomatoes (2 large), coarsely grated', '3\u00bc cups/750ml chicken stock or water', '1 tbsp sugar', 'Salt and black pepper', '\u00be cup plus 2 tbsp/175g Egyptian rice or arborio rice (see note below)', '9 oz/250g ground lamb', '\u00bc cup/60ml olive oil', '\u00bd tsp ground cinnamon', '\u00be tsp ground allspice', '\u00bd tsp ground cumin', 'About 3 green onions, finely sliced (\u2153 cup/35g)', '\u00be cup/15g mint leaves, roughly chopped', '\u00be cup/15g parsley leaves, roughly chopped', '1 cup/20g dill, roughly chopped', '1 red chile, seeded and finely diced (1 tbsp/10g)', '1 lemon: finely grate the zest to get 1 tsp', '3 tbsp water', '1\u00bd lb/700g eggplants (between 3 and 6, depending on size)', '1\u00bd lb/700g zucchini (between 3 and 6, depending on size)', '7 tbsp/100ml olive oil', '6 garlic cloves, finely chopped', '1 tbsp coriander seeds, lightly crushed in a mortar and pestle', '1 red chile, seeded and finely diced (1 tbsp/10g)', '\u00bc cup/5g parsley leaves, roughly chopped', '\u00bc cup/5g mint leaves, roughly torn', '\u00bc cup/5g dill leaves', '1 green onion, thinly sliced (2 tbsp/10g)', '1 cup/250g Greek yogurt']. Steps:To make the sauce, put the oil into a saucepan or casserole pan with a lid\u2014about 10 inches/25cm wide\u2014and place over medium heat. Add the onions and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until soft and caramelized. Add the rest of the sauce ingredients, along with 2\u00bd tsp of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Simmer over medium heat for about 10 minutes, stirring from time to time, then remove from the heat and set aside.\nTo make the stuffing, while the sauce is cooking, place all the ingredients in a large bowl with 1\u00bd tsp of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Mix well, using your hands to make sure that everything is well incorporated. If making in advance, keep in the fridge until ready to use.\nTrim the stalks from the eggplants, then insert a manakra (or peeler or corer) into the eggplant; you want it to be very close to the skin\u2014about \u215b inch/3mm away\u2014but not so close that it tears and won\u2019t hold its shape when it\u2019s stuffed. Scoop out the flesh to create a generous cavity. You don\u2019t need the flesh anymore, but keep it for another recipe; it can be cut into cubes and steamed or added to your next omelette. If your eggplants are particularly large, slice them in half, crosswise, and scoop out the flesh using a regular small serrated knife\u2014be sure to keep one end of each half intact, so that the stuffing does not fall out!\nUse the manakra or a swivel peeler to scoop out the zucchini flesh. Keep about \u215b inch/3mm of flesh attached to the skin inside the zucchini and about \u00bd inch/1cm from the end intact\u2014they need to be robust enough to keep the stuffing inside. Again, keep the scooped-out flesh to use elsewhere.\nUsing your hands, so that you can push in a bit of stuffing at a time, fill all the eggplant and zucchini cavities. Stop filling them about \u00bd inch/1cm from the top of each vegetable; the stuffing needs some space to expand inside the vegetables when they are cooking.\nGently lower the stuffed vegetables into the sauce. They won\u2019t fit in a single layer, but try to avoid too much overlap and submerge them in the sauce as much as you can. Return the sauce to medium heat and, once simmering, decrease the heat to low. Cover the pan and simmer very gently for 90 minutes, or until the rice is completely cooked through and soft\u2014test if it is ready by sticking a knife into the middle of one of the vegetables; it should go in very easily. Don\u2019t worry if some of the rice/stuffing spills into the tomato sauce, this can happen and it will be fine when served.\nTo make the adha, meanwhile, put the oil into a small frying pan and place over medium heat. After about 1 minute, add the garlic and decrease the heat to medium-low. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring very often, until the garlic is golden and crispy. Keep a close eye on the pan here; you don\u2019t want the oil to get too hot and for the garlic to burn. Reserving the oil as you pour, strain the garlic through a sieve. Set the garlic aside\u2014it will crisp up as it cools down\u2014and return the oil to the pan. Add the coriander seeds and chile and cook for about 1 minute, stirring a few times, until fragrant. Remove from the heat, transfer to a separate bowl, and set aside until needed.\nWhen the vegetables are cooked and the sauce is thick and rich (but still pourable), use a slotted spoon to carefully lift the vegetables out of the pan. Pour the sauce onto a large serving platter (or individual serving plates) with a rim and top with the stuffed vegetables. Spoon on the adha\u2014the coriander-chile oil first, followed by the fried garlic\u2014then sprinkle with the fresh herbs and green onion. Serve warm or at room temperature, with the yogurt spooned alongside.",

Steps:Bring plums, brown sugar, and salt to a boil in a medium heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until fruit is softened and juices deepen in color, about 8 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve set over a medium bowl, pushing plum flesh through; discard skins. Return sauce to pan and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Cook, still stirring, until reduced to about \u2154 cup, about 3 minutes. Pour ripple into a jar and let cool, then cover and chill 1 hour before using.\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0F. Place walnuts on 1 side of a rimmed baking sheet; season with salt. Toast, tossing halfway through, 8 minutes (nuts should not be quiet golden brown yet). Remove from oven and add sesame seeds on empty side of baking sheet. Toast until nuts and seeds are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Let cool; chop nuts. Combine nuts, sesame seeds, maple syrup, and salt in a small jar or bowl and stir well. Cover and set aside.\nLightly butter pan and line with a parchment paper round. Heat brown sugar, tahini, and remaining \u00bd cup (1 stick) unsalted butter until bubbling in a medium heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring until butter is melted and sugar is dissolved. Cook, without stirring, 1 minute. Let cool slightly.\nStir vanilla bean paste and salt followed by egg into brown sugar mixture. Sift flour and baking powder through a fine-mesh sieve into mixture and fold to barely combine. Scrape batter into the prepared pan. Bake until golden around the edges, evenly tan across the top, and puffed in the center, about 20 minutes.\nTransfer pan to a wire rack and let blondie base cool. Run a knife around the sides to help base release but keep springform pan intact, then cover and chill in freezer at least 15 minutes or until ready to use.\nCut 3 pints of ice cream out of their containers and place in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. (Alternatively, you can beat in a large bowl with a wooden spoon or stiff rubber spatula until the consistency of cake batter.) Mix on low speed 2 minutes, then working up to medium speed, beat until barely pliable. It will soften further as it sits, but you want it to be sticky and slightly challenging to spread when you assemble cake. Chill in the freezer at any point if it becomes too soft and melted.\nRemove blondie base and remaining 2 still-frozen pints of ice cream from freezer. Using an offset spatula, spread a third of softened ice cream over base. Using a spring-loaded ice cream scoop, scoop out and place mounds of 1-pint still-frozen ice cream on top in a random manner. Dollop one third of maple ripple over ice cream, avoiding edges of pan. Next, drizzle one third of plum ripple over ice cream, creating stripes. Repeat layering process, using half of remaining softened ice cream, all of remaining frozen ice cream, half of remaining maple ripple, and half of remaining plum ripple.

Steps:To make the batter, combine the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, sugar, doenjang, and pepper in a medium bowl and mix well to blend. Add the club soda, egg yolk, and garlic and mix gently using a whisk. Do not whisk too much, or extra gluten will form in the batter, making it too thick and doughy. Whisk about 10 times, then let the batter rest for 10 minutes in the freezer so any remaining small clumps of flour can dissolve and blend into the mixture by themselves.\nWhen you\u2019re ready to make the pancakes, line a sheet pan with paper towels and set aside. Fold the scallions into the cold batter.\nSet a 10-inch nonstick saut\u00e9 pan over high heat and add about 1 tablespoon of the oil. When the oil begins to shimmer and just barely smoke, add 1 cup of the scallion batter to the center of the pan. Using a spatula, spread it out to form a 7-inch pancake. (You don\u2019t want the pancake to touch the sides of the pan, or the edges may burn before the center is cooked through.) Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the bottom of the pancake has set. Once it has set, gently slide your spatula under the edges of the pancake and lift them, tilting the pan, so some of the hot oil runs underneath the pancake. Then cook for 2 to 3 minutes more, until the bottom is a deep golden brown and crisp. You can check the color by gently lifting an edge of the pancake with your spatula. Flip the pancake and cook on the other side for 3 to 4 minutes, until it is golden brown on the second side and cooked through. Transfer to the prepared sheet pan to drain. Wipe out the pan, set it back over high heat, add another tablespoon or so of oil, and repeat until all of the pancakes are cooked. The finished pancakes can be kept in a low (200\u00b0F) oven on a clean sheet pan while you cook the remaining batches, but it\u2019s best to eat them right away.\nCut each pancake into quarters and serve with small bowls of the Pajeon Sauce and ice-cold makgeolli (Korean rice wine).",

Ingredients:['\u2153 cup vegetable oil', '4 Tbsp. whole black mustard seeds (or 4 tbsp. store-bought coarsely crushed mustard seeds)', '3 Tbsp. whole fenugreek seeds (or 3 Tbsp. store-bought coarsely crushed fenugreek)', '1 tsp. asafetida powder', '1 Tbsp. ground cayenne (to taste) or 1 large serrano pepper, deseeded, and sliced thin', '\u2153 cup julienned ginger (optional, see Pre-Prep below)', '2-4 Tbsp. white vinegar', '2 tsp. kosher salt (optional)', '2 cups mixed vegetables', 'prepped as follows']. Steps:Pre-Prep: Trim fresh vegetables like cauliflower, carrots, radish, and others into bite sized pieces, and no larger than the container they will be stored in. Flash steam firm vegetables like cauliflower and carrots in a colander over boiling water for just a minute or two: the pieces should still be firm. Lay them on a kitchen towel to dry. If using fresh turmeric, cover the chopping board in plastic wrap, and wear gloves. Scrape off the skin with a spoon as you would for ginger and rinse it clean to wash away any tough bits. Pat each fingerling down and slice into thin rounds or to match the ginger, and place on a paper towel to air dry. All vegetables must be dry to touch before pickling. To prepare ginger, peel and slice ginger into eighth-inch-thick slices, and chop them to look like carrot sticks. Spread on a paper towel and set aside to air dry for 15-20 minutes.\nIf using whole mustard seeds or whole fenugreek seeds, in two separate sets, crush each in a spice mill in short bursts until they each are broken down but not powdered. They should be the consistency of coffee grounds.\nMethod: Heat the oil in a large, wide mouth saucepan until it is hot but not smoking. Reduce the heat to low. Slowly add all the spices: mustard halves, fenugreek halves, asafetida powder, cayenne pepper if using, along with the serrano pepper if using, and ginger sticks. Add vinegar and salt. Allow this to sizzle for a minute on low. Stir to allow the heat to distribute evenly. When the oil is aromatic, slowly add the trimmed vegetables and stir in well. Turn up the heat and let this cook for 4-5 minutes until vegetables appear to have absorbed the spices a little. Turn off the heat and cover with a paper towel to capture any steam. Allow this to come to room temperature before storing.\nTo Store: Use smaller (4 \u2013 6 oz.) sanitized and dried glass jars to store the pickle. Using a clean and dry spoon that is smaller than the mouth of the jar, ladle out portions of the pickle into each jar. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t get the oils or juices when first filling the jars. Fill jars at least a half inch below the rim of the jar. Shake them once to allow the pieces to settle. Divide up any of the liquid over each of these jars, taking care that each jar has some of the spicy sauce. Lightly shake each jar to ensure the liquid finds its way into the nooks and crannies of vegetable pieces. Close the lid and store in the fridge. The pickle is ready to eat immediately after it is made, but the flavors are pronounced after a day or two. Serve using a clean and dry fork or spoon for each serving to avoid contamination.",

        "content": "We will be making Homestyle Dosas with Tomato Chutney, here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['2 cups long-grain white rice', '\u00bd cup whole or split urad dal (black gram)', '\u00bd tsp. fenugreek seeds', '1 tsp. kosher salt', '2 tsp. plus 2 Tbsp. vegetable oil', '1 small onion, finely chopped', '2\u20133 small green chiles (such as serrano), seeds removed if desired, finely chopped', '4 small tomatoes or canned whole peeled tomatoes, chopped', 'Kosher salt', '2 tsp. black mustard seeds', '8\u201310 fresh or frozen curry leaves', '1 dried red chile (such as bird or chile de \u00e1rbol)', '1 tsp. split or whole urad dal (black gram)', 'A pinch of asafoetida (optional)', '1 tsp. ghee or clarified butter', 'melted', 'divided', 'plus more for griddle']. Steps:The morning before you make your batter, rinse rice in a fine-mesh sieve under cold running water, until water runs almost clear. Transfer to a large bowl and cover with 4 cups cold water. If your tap water is heavily chlorinated, use filtered water for soaking as chlorine will inhibit fermentation later on.\nPick over dal for debris, then rinse in sieve under cold running water. Transfer to a medium bowl and add fenugreek. Cover with 2 cups cold water (again using filtered if needed). Let rice and dal soak at least 8 hours and up to 10 hours.\nDrain rice, holding back grains with your hand and pouring off most of the soaking liquid into a pitcher or large measuring glass. Transfer rice to a blender. Pulse to get things going, then pur\u00e9e, sparingly adding soaking liquid as needed, until a paste forms (mixture should be foamy and still slightly gritty when rubbed between your fingers). Pour into a clean large bowl. Repeat process with dal mixture, then vigorously stir blended dal into rice paste.\nAdd reserved soaking liquid as needed to create a pourable batter that falls off the spoon in a steady stream and gradually dissolves into itself. Stir in salt. (If you are in a warm climate, add salt after fermentation to keep batter from becoming overly sour.) Cover bowl with a kitchen towel, then a silicone lid (this will keep the surface of the batter from drying out). Set bowl in a warm spot (a proofing box or an oven with the light on and a bowl of hot water placed inside work well). Let batter sit until airy and pleasantly sour (when you drizzle it from a spoon, it should fall on itself in slowly dissolving ribbons), 4\u20136 hours in a very warm environment and as long as 2 days in a very cool environment. In general, 14 hours is a safe starting point.\nDo ahead: Batter can be made 1 week ahead. Once fermented, cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before cooking. Thin with water if needed to reach a thick but pourable consistency.\nHeat 2 tsp. oil in a medium skillet over medium. Cook onion, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add green chiles and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Reduce heat to low, add tomatoes and any juices and a generous pinch of salt. Cook, stirring often, until tomatoes are tender, 7\u20139 minutes. Carefully transfer to clean blender or a food processor and blend until smooth; reserve skillet. Taste chutney and season with more salt if needed. Transfer to a small bowl.\nWipe out reserved skillet and heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in skillet over medium. Cook mustard seeds, stirring constantly, until they start to pop, about 30 seconds. Add curry leaves, dried red chile, and dal and cook, stirring occasionally, until curry leaves wilt and crisp and dal is starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Mix in asafoetida, if using, and remove spice oil from heat. Mix into chutney.\nTo cook dosas, heat a griddle or large skillet (the larger the better; you want the batter to have room to spread) over medium. Sprinkle a little water on surface; if it sizzles you\u2019re good to go. (It\u2019s important though not to let griddle get hotter than medium. If it\u2019s too hot, the batter will start to cook before it\u2019s fully spread out, yielding a thick dosa, or worse, a thin dosa that tears. Adjust heat as needed). Brush griddle with a thin layer of ghee, wiping off excess with a folded paper towel. Ladle a generous \u2153-cupful of batter in the center of griddle and use ladle to spread batter, working outward in continuous circles and never lifting ladle off surface, to create an 8\"-diameter round. Ridges of thick and thin batter will form naturally. Cook dosa 30 seconds, then drizzle \u215b tsp. ghee over batter. For a spongier dosa, cover with a large bowl and steam until cooked through, about 2 minutes (cooked underside should show through thinner spots, and thicker spots should be opaque and bouncy). For a drier dosa, cook until surface is mostly set, about 2 minutes, then, using a fish spatula or other wide spatula, flip dosa over (it should easily lift from the griddle at this point) and cook until second side is lightly golden, about 20 seconds. Fold dosa in half so toasted side is facing out and transfer to a plate. Repeat process with remaining batter and ghee.\nServe dosas as they are ready with chutney alongside for dipping.",

Ingredients:['3 tablespoons brown or golden flaxseed', '3 tablespoons awaze dipping sauce', '14 oz (400 g) cooked or canned chickpeas, drained and rinsed', 'Salt']. Steps:Heat a small dry frying pan over medium-low heat. Add the flaxseed and lightly dry-toast for about 2 minutes, stirring and shaking the pan, until aromatic. Transfer to a dish and leave to cool. Once cool, grind using an electric spice or coffee grinder.\nIn a Dutch oven or saut\u00e9 pan, heat 2 tablespoons of water over low heat and stir in 1 tablespoon of the awaze. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring continuously, then gradually work in the remaining 2 tablespoons of awaze, along with the ground flaxseed and 1 cup (250 ml) of water. Reduce the heat to its lowest possible level, cover, and cook, stirring frequently, for 20 minutes. Add a touch more water if it looks like the mixture is drying out\u2014it should still be a bit runny at the end.\nMeanwhile, place the chickpeas in a saucepan and cover with 2 cups (500 ml) of water. Bring to a boil, remove from the heat, and soak in the liquid until ready to use. Drain the chickpeas, reserving about 1 cup (240 ml) of the liquid. Add the chickpeas to the awaze-flaxseed mixture, generously season with salt, and mix well. Tip in some of the reserved cooking water if needed so that the sauce is a touch runny and evenly coats the chickpeas. Cook for a couple of minutes to combine the flavors before serving.",

        "content": "We will be making Hickory-Smoked Baby Back Ribs, here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['5 Tbsp (75 mL) packed brown sugar', '3 Tbsp (45 mL) kosher salt', '2 Tbsp (30 mL) sweet smoked paprika 4 tsp (20 mL) ancho chili powder', '1 Tbsp (15 mL) paprika', '1 Tbsp (15 mL) onion powder', '1 Tbsp (15 mL) freshly cracked black pepper 2 tsp (10 mL) dried thyme leaves', '6 racks baby back ribs, about 6 lb (2.7 kg)', '4 medium chunks hickory wood, soaked in water for at least 2 hours (if using a charcoal grill) or 4 cups (1 L) hickory wood chips, soaked in water for at least 2 hours (if using a gas grill)', '3\u20444 cup (185 mL) apple cider', '1\u20442 cup (125 mL) ketchup', '3 Tbsp (45 mL) red wine vinegar', '1 Tbsp (15 mL) Dijon mustard', '2 tsp (10 mL) light soy sauce', '1 tsp (5 mL) Worcestershire sauce', '1 tsp (5 mL) molasses', '1\u20442 tsp (2 mL) ancho chili powder', '1\u20442 tsp (2 mL) ground cumin', '1\u20442 tsp (2 mL) minced garlic', '1\u20444 tsp (1 mL) freshly ground black pepper']. Steps:For the ribs, stir together the sugar, salt, smoked paprika, chili powder, regular paprika, onion powder, black pepper and thyme. Set aside.\nWith a small, sharp knife, release the edge of the membrane on the back of each rack of ribs. Grasp the edge with needle-nose pliers or a piece of paper towel and peel the membrane off the rack. (If you leave the membrane on, the ribs will be chewy.)\nSpread the dry rub all over each rack of ribs until completely coated. Make sure you press the dry rub into the meat. This is where your flavor is going to come from. Arrange the ribs in a rib rack, with all the racks facing the same direction. A rib rack has 8 slab compartments, looks like a rack of coat hangers and can be purchased at most barbecue stores.\nFire up your charcoal grill and prep the grill for cooking over indirect heat. You need a low temperature of around 250 to 300\u00b0F (120 to 150\u00b0C) to grill the ribs. For gas grills, preheat the grill to low then turn off one side of the grill to achieve indirect heat. Place a drip tray on the cooler side of the grate and half fill the pan with warm water or the beer of your choice.\nDrain 2 chunks of hickory, place them on top of the charcoal and set the grate in place. For gas barbecues, place half of the hickory chips in a foil pouch and place the pouch directly on the heated side of the grill. Wait for the hickory to start to smoke.\nPlace the rib racks over indirect heat as far from the heat as possible, with the bone sides facing toward the heat. Close the lid and close the top vent on a charcoal grill about halfway. This will maintain a temperature between 250 and 300\u00b0F (120 and 150\u00b0C). Cook the ribs for 2 hours.\nOnce the ribs are on, it\u2019s time to start working on the barbecue sauce. If you have a side burner this can be done outside. If you don\u2019t, go inside and use your stove top to simmer your sauce. Combine all the ingredients in a small saucepan set over medium heat. Simmer for 20 to 30 minutes or until the sauce reaches a glaze consistency. Remove the saucepan from the heat and set aside to cool.\nThe first batch of charcoal should be cooling down after 2 hours. Now is the time to use your chimney starter and get another batch of charcoal lit. Add the remaining wood chunks to the coals to get a little more smoke. If using a gas grill, wrap the remaining chips in foil and place directly on the hotter side of the grate. Close the lid and grill for another 2 hours. Make sure to come back every hour on the hour to check the temperature and to add more charcoal, if necessary. In the last hour of grilling, your ribs will start to show signs of cooking all the way through. When the meat pulls back from the bone, the ribs are almost ready. Baste the ribs with the barbecue sauce during the last 5 to 10 minutes of cooking. I like to tent my ribs before serving, so take them off the grill and let them rest, loosely covered with foil, for 10 minutes.",

Steps:To make the cake: Set the oven to 350\u00b0F and adjust the rack positions to the middle and top third. Spray three 8-inch round cake pans well with baking spray.\nSift the flour with the baking soda.\nIn a large bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the eggs well, then beat in the sugar, oil, and vinegar.

Let the cakes cool in the pans on racks for 15 minutes.\nRun a knife around the sides of the pans and invert the cakes onto the racks to cool completely. Once they\u2019re cool, refrigerate the cakes for 20 to 30 minutes to make icing them easier.\nTo make the icing: Combine everything in a medium bowl and mix well until very smooth.

Add a second layer, right side up, and spread with more frosting. Top with the third layer, right side up, and spread the frosting evenly around the sides of the cake and on top; check for any places where you can see through to the cake. Finally, sprinkle the pecans evenly all over the top of the cake.\nOnce the frosting sets, cut into slices to serve.

Add the buttermilk, stirring gently and compressing with your hands until a shaggy dough is formed. Dump out onto a floured work surface and knead until it comes together into a solid mass. Roll it out into a 1\u00bc-inch (3-cm)-thick disk. Using a 3-inch (7.5-cm) biscuit cutter, punch out 6 biscuits, folding and re-rolling the dough if needed. Place the biscuits on the lined sheet tray, brush with more buttermilk, sprinkle with raw sugar if using, and bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until slightly puffed and golden brown.

Cook over medium-low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the liquid reduces by half. Set aside to cool and thicken.\nTo make the whipped cream topping, when you\u2019re ready to serve, beat together the cream and honey in a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, or in a bowl with an electric mixer, until stiff peaks form, about 3 minutes. Split the cooled biscuits in half and spoon on some of the strawberries along with some of their juices so it soaks into the bottom biscuit. Top with a dollop of whipped cream, followed by a drizzle of the balsamic glaze. Top with the other half of the biscuit, and repeat with more strawberries, more cream, and another drizzle of glaze.

Steps:Make the crust: In the bowl of a food processor, pulse together the flour, sugar, and 2 teaspoons salt until just combined. Add the butter and pulse a few more times until the mixture is coarse but the butter pieces are still visible. Slowly add the ice water and pulse to form a dough, six to eight pulses. If the dough looks and feels very dry, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Divide the dough in half and wrap each half tightly in plastic wrap; flatten each piece into a disc. Refrigerate the dough for 1 hour.\nMake the filling: In a large bowl, mix together the peaches, sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a pinch of salt. Set aside.\nPreheat the oven to 375\u00baF.\nRemove the dough from the refrigerator and cut in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll it into a 9 x 13-inch rectangle, about \u00bc inch thick. Set aside and repeat with the second piece of dough.\nLine a 9 x 13-inch baking dish with one of the dough rectangles, pressing any excess dough against the sides of the dish. Pour in the peach filling and spread it evenly. Place the second rectangle of dough on top of the peaches and tuck the excess dough into corners. Brush the dough with the beaten egg and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar. Pierce the top with the tip of a sharp knife in several places to allow steam to escape while baking. Bake until the top crust is golden brown, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Let cool on a rack before serving. Serve with ice cream.",

Ingredients:['Scant 2 cups (230 g) all-purpose flour', '2\u00bd tsp (11 g) baking powder', '3 tbsp (45 ml) milk', '2 tbsp (30 ml) elderflower cordial', '1 cup (225 g) unsalted butter', '1 cup plus 2 tbsp (230 g) superfine/caster sugar', 'Zest of 1 lemon', '4 eggs', 'Approximately 1 lb (400\u2013450 g) fresh strawberries', '\u00bc cup (50 g) superfine/caster sugar', '2 tsp (10 g) vanilla bean paste', '\u00bd cup plus 1 tbsp (150 g) egg whites', '1 cup (200 g) superfine/caster sugar', '1\u2153 cups (300 g) unsalted butter, softened', '6 tbsp (90 ml) elderflower cordial', 'Fresh strawberries, to decorate', 'Fresh elderflower', 'to decorate']. Steps:Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Grease the base and sides of three deep, round 6-inch (15-cm) cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper.\nTo make the cake, sift together the flour and baking powder in a large bowl, and set aside. Mix the milk and elderflower cordial in a small bowl and set aside. Using a stand mixer or electric whisk, beat the butter, sugar and lemon zest for 5 minutes, or until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. If the mixture looks like it\u2019s starting to curdle, add 1 tablespoon (8 g) of the flour mixture. Turn the mixer speed to low and add half of the flour mixture followed by the milk and elderflower. Stir in the remaining flour and divide the batter equally into the prepared cake pans. Bake the cakes for 35 to 37 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool in their pans for 10 minutes before turning them out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Once cool, wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and place in the fridge to firm up.\nTo make the pur\u00e9e, preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Slice the stems off the strawberries, cut them in half and put them into a baking dish. Toss the fruit with the sugar and vanilla. Roast the strawberries in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, stirring once halfway. The strawberries are done once they are soft and fragrant and the juices have turned into a syrup. Leave the strawberries to cool completely before transferring them to a food processor or blender and pulsing until smooth. Store in an airtight container in the fridge until you\u2019re ready to use it.\nTo make the buttercream, add the egg whites and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer or a heatproof bowl. Make sure there are no traces of grease in the bowl as this will stop the meringue from whipping up. Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, making sure that the base doesn\u2019t touch the water. Whisk the eggs and sugar constantly until the mixture reaches a temperature of about 150\u00b0F (65\u00b0C). If you don\u2019t have a thermometer, rub a little of the mixture in between your fingers. The eggs should be hot to the touch with all the sugar dissolved.\nRemove the bowl from the heat and start whisking the egg whites on high speed in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or with an electric whisk. Beat until the whites are thick and have doubled in volume. Once the bowl is cool to the touch and with the mixer still running, add the butter a piece at a time. The meringue will deflate and will start to look a little runny or curdled. Don\u2019t panic\u2014this is normal. Continue beating until you have added in all of the butter and the mixture is smooth and glossy. If after 10 minutes, your meringue buttercream is still soupy, chill it in the fridge for 20 minutes and then beat again. Add about 1/2 cup (125 g) of the strawberry puree and beat the buttercream for 2 minutes, or until smooth. Leave the buttercream at room temperature until you are ready to assemble.\nUnwrap the cakes from the fridge and if any of them are domed, level them with a serrated knife or a cake leveler. All the layers need to be completely flat to ensure you don\u2019t end up with a wonky cake. Brush each cake layer with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of elderflower cordial. Place one layer of cake on a cake board and put this board on a turntable, if using. If your buttercream has firmed up, whip it up again in the mixer until smooth. Add a scoop of buttercream and spread it out evenly with an offset spatula, pushing the buttercream right to the edge (it\u2019s fine if it spills over). Place the next layer on top of the first, but this time add about 1 tablespoon (8 g) of strawberry pur\u00e9e on top of the buttercream layer, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) clear around the edge. Place the last layer topside down to give you a perfectly flat top.\nFrost the top and sides of the cake with a thin layer of buttercream. Smooth the edges as much as you can with a bench scraper or palette knife. This is the crumb coat layer that will trap any stray crumbs and act as a base for the next layer. Place the cake in the fridge for 20 minutes to firm up before adding another layer of buttercream on the top and sides. Fill a piping bag fitted with an open star nozzle (I\u2019ve used Wilton 8B) with any remaining buttercream and pipe swirls across the edge to make a wreath. Top the cake with fresh strawberries, a drizzle of any leftover puree and fresh elderflower (if in season).",

Season with salt. (To make ahead, refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 8 hours.)\nTo make the jerk spice rub: In a small bowl, combine the garlic powder, onion powder, allspice, salt, nutmeg, chile powder, cinnamon, cayenne, and black pepper in a small bowl.\nUse a butter knife to pry the membrane off the bone side of the ribs. Once you get a piece of the membrane loose, grab it with a paper towel and pull it toward the other end of the slab to remove it. Rub the Jerk Spice Rub evenly over the ribs. Arrange the ribs in a 15-by-10-in/38-by-25-cm baking pan. Pour the Jerk Marinade over the ribs, turning to coat both sides. Cover baking pan with aluminum foil and refrigerate for at least 6 hours and up to 24 hours.\nRemove ribs from marinade, letting the excess drip off. Transfer the ribs to a baking sheet and allow to come to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Brush with the Habanero Vinegar.\nTo cook ribs using a charcoal grill: Prepare grill for indirect cooking over medium heat. Place a shallow metal pan filled with water in the center of the grill and arrange the hot coals around it. Lightly oil the grill grates. Place the ribs on the grate directly above the water-filled pan, cover the grill, and cook until tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Add coals as needed to maintain medium heat.\nTo cook ribs using a gas grill: Preheat the grill with all the burners on high. Lightly oil the grill grates. Place the ribs on the grate, turn off the burner directly under the ribs, and reduce the other burners to medium heat. Cover the grill and cook until tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.\nAfter 45 minutes, brush the ribs with some of the Pineapple Glaze, and brush them two or three times before serving. Do not flip the ribs during cooking. When the ribs are done, they will be well browned and the meat will have shrunk back from the ends of the bones. Transfer ribs to a cutting board and let stand 5 minutes before cutting rack into individual ribs. Serve warm with the Pineapple Salsa.",

Steps:Make the muffins: Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Generously coat nine wells of a standard muffin tin with coconut oil.\nPut the dates in a small heatproof bowl and cover with boiling water. Let soak for about 5 minutes. Drain the dates, reserving the soaking liquid, and transfer them to a food processor. Add 1 tablespoon of the reserved soaking liquid and process, scraping down the sides and adding more of the reserved soaking liquid if necessary, until mostly creamy but with a few chunks remaining.\nPlace the prepared muffin tin in the oven to heat for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, sift together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Whisk until blended.\nPut the flaxseeds and 6 tablespoons water in a medium bowl and whisk until well blended. Whisk in the pureed dates and the coconut oil until smooth. Whisk in the oat milk until well combined. Add the oat milk mixture to the cornmeal mixture and stir until just combined.\nWhen the muffin tin is hot, remove it from the oven and immediately scrape the batter into the prepared muffin cups, distributing it evenly among them (they should be a little over three-quarters full).\nBake until the muffins are golden brown, 16 to 18 minutes. Let cool in the tin for about 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool a bit more.\nMake the whipped sweet corn: While the muffins are cooling, in a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and saut\u00e9, stirring often, until soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the corn, sugar, and salt and cook, stirring often, until the corn is just tender, about 5 minutes.\nScrape the contents of the skillet into a food processor. Add the cashew cream and process until silky smooth, adding water as necessary to reach the desired consistency. Taste and season with lemon juice, salt, and white pepper. Transfer to a serving bowl. Serve the warm muffins slathered with whipped sweet corn and topped with pepper jelly.",

Steps:Stir together the flour, sugar, and salt, then add the cold butter and toss to combine. Use your fingers to rub the butter into the flour, pinching it between your thumbs and fingers until you\u2019ve got a ragged mixture with irregular pieces of butter still intact, the largest about the size of an almond. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons of the ice water over the mixture and use a fork to quickly incorporate. Keep adding water by the \u00bd tablespoon until it appears just moistened\u2014a dough that\u2019s too wet will lead to a tough crust, so err on the side of it seeming a little dry. Dump the mixture onto a piece of plastic wrap. Working from the outside of the plastic, shape it into a flat disc. Wrap, then refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to overnight.\nPreheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.\nUsing the same bowl as for the crust, combine the fruit, 3 tablespoons of the sugar, and the salt. In a small bowl, stir together the flour and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar.\nPlace the chilled dough on a lightly floured work surface and roll into a circle about 13 inches in diameter. Roll from the center, rotating 90 degrees after each roll, and adding a bit more flour as needed if the dough sticks. Drape the rolled dough over a rolling pin and transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Spread the flour-sugar mixture evenly over the dough, leaving a clean rim of about an inch, and pile the fruit on top. Fold the crust around over the fruit, pleating rustically as you go. Brush the exposed pastry with water, then sprinkle generously\u2014over the crust and the fruit, too\u2014with sugar. Transfer to the oven and bake until the fruit juices are bubbling in the center and the crust is golden, 50 to 60 minutes, or more depending on the fruit.\nServe warm, with fresh whipped cream or ice cream, or cold, perhaps for breakfast, with yogurt.",

Steps:Wash the rice in several changes of water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water, generously covered, for at least 30 minutes. (This is optional but results in softer, more evenly cooked rice.) Drain thoroughly using a fine-mesh sieve.\nIn a soup pot, dry-roast and stir the lentils continuously over medium heat until they are golden brown and have a nutty aroma, 2 to 3 minutes. (This step is optional but reduces the stickiness of the dal.) Thoroughly wash the lentils using a fine mesh colander. Return them to the pot, together with the rice, and add 3 1\u20442 cups of water. Bring to a boil. Skim the foam off the top. Add the turmeric powder, 2 tablespoons of the ghee, and the ginger to the boiling mixture.\nWhile the rice and lentils are cooking, put 1\u20442 teaspoon of the ghee in a tempering pot or small pan over medium heat. Add the cashews, stirring them until they are fragrant and turn golden brown, a few minutes. Set the cashews aside to cool in a bowl lined with a paper towel.

When melted, add the crushed black peppercorns and cumin seeds and the asafetida. Fry for a few seconds until fragrant. Turn off the heat.\nImmediately pour the spiced ghee over the rice. To get all of the spiced ghee out of the pot, put a spoonful of the rice mixture into the pot, stir, and spoon it back into the rest of the dish. Taste for salt and adjust as needed.

Let sit until mixture is foamy, about 5 minutes.\nAdd whole wheat flour, salt, and 2 Tbsp. oil to yeast mixture and mix to combine. Fit mixer with dough hook and, with mixer on low speed, gradually add 3 cups (375 g) bread flour, mixing until a shaggy dough forms, about 4 minutes from when you start adding the flour. Stop mixer and scrape down sides of bowl to incorporate any dry bits into dough. Increase mixer speed to medium and knead until dough is smooth and shiny, about 5 minutes.\nTransfer dough to a lightly floured surface and knead briefly to bring together. Shape into a ball, place in a large lightly oiled bowl, and turn to coat. Cover bowl and let dough sit in warm draft-free spot until doubled in size, 1\u20131\u00bd hours.

Cover and chill, or freeze up to 6 months.\nPrepare a grill for medium-high indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill; for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off). Clean grate. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 4 pieces. Working one at a time, gently shape into balls. Transfer to a lightly floured small rimmed baking sheet and cover. Let sit 20\u201330 minutes.\nPlace a ball of dough on a lightly floured surface (keep remaining balls covered) and, using your fingers, press out to an 8\" round. Drape dough over the backs of your hands and gently pull and stretch, rotating dough as you go, until about 12\" in diameter (it\u2019s okay if it\u2019s not a perfect circle).\nBrush dough with oil. Place, oiled side down, on grill over direct heat and cook until large bubbles appear across surface, dough stiffens, and underside is dark brown, about 2 minutes. Brush top with oil, turn over, and cook just to lightly dry out second side, about 30 seconds.\nUsing tongs and a metal spatula, move dough over to cooler side of grill. Top with a spoonful of passata or burst cherry tomatoes and one quarter of cheese (either alone or in combination). Add pepperoni or salami (if using), then some of the lemony Swiss chard, and/or Rosemary Agrodolce as desired. Carefully slide pizza back over direct heat. Cook until cheese is melted and toppings are heated through, about 2 minutes. If dough is in danger of burning on underside but toppings need more time, return pizza to cooler side, cover grill, and cook another 1\u20132 minutes.\nTransfer pizza to a cutting board and drizzle with more oil. Top with basil and red pepper flakes if desired.\nRepeat with remaining ingredients to make 3 more pizzas.",

Dijon mustard', '6 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil', 'Freshly ground black pepper', '8 oz. green beans, trimmed', '1 large head of Bibb lettuce', '1 small bunch chives, sliced into (2\u201d-long) pieces', '1 cup basil leaves', '1 bunch radishes, trimmed, halved, cut into wedges if large', '1 cup torn peperoncini', '1 avocado', 'thinly sliced']. Steps:Place chicken in a large saucepan and pour in 4 cups cold water to cover; add 3 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 3\u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt. Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat, then immediately turn over chicken with tongs. Cover pot, remove from heat, and let chicken sit until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 150\u00b0F, 5\u201310 minutes (depending on thickness of breast). Transfer chicken to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, squeeze lemon halves into a medium bowl. Whisk in mustard, then gradually stream in oil, whisking constantly until dressing is thick and emulsified. Season with salt and pepper.\nUsing a rolling pin, whack green beans on a cutting board until skins split and insides are softened but not pulverized.\nTransfer beans to a medium bowl and drizzle in 2 Tbsp. dressing. Massage beans with your hands to break down further and coat; season with salt.\nSeparate lettuce leaves; toss in another medium bowl with chives and basil. Arrange on a platter.\nToss radishes, peperoncini, and 1 Tbsp. dressing in the same bowl; season with salt. Slice chicken \u00bc\u201d\u2013\u00bd\u201d thick; season with pepper.

Steps:Combine buttermilk and 6 Tbsp. oil in a small microwave-safe bowl (it won\u2019t get smooth and that\u2019s okay) and heat in the microwave in three 10-second bursts until just about body temperature (it shouldn\u2019t feel hot or cold to the touch); an instant-read thermometer will register about 98\u00b0F. (Alternatively, you can heat in a small saucepan over medium-low, stirring constantly, about 1 minute.)\nWhisk egg, brown sugar, and yeast in a liquid measuring cup to combine, then whisk into buttermilk mixture.\nPulse flour, baking soda, and salt in a food processor to combine. With the motor running, stream in buttermilk mixture. Process until about 80% of the dough comes together into a ball (mixture will look very wet at first, then begin to pull away from the sides of processor), about 2 minutes.\nUsing a bowl scraper or rubber spatula, scrape dough onto an unfloured surface. (It should still be pretty wet and sticky.) Knead, pushing it away from you, then pulling it back toward you, until a smooth ball forms, about 3 minutes. The dough will grow silkier, tighter, and easier to work with as you knead.\nRoll out dough into a rough 8\" square. Fold dough over onto itself to make an 8x4\" rectangle, then flatten it slightly and fold over once more to make a 4\" square. Roll dough back out to an 8\" square and repeat folding process (you should be back at a 4\" square). Pour remaining 1 Tbsp. oil into a medium bowl and add dough (still folded); turn to coat. Cover bowl tightly and chill dough until doubled in volume, at least 8 hours and up to 1 day.\nPlace dates in a small bowl and pour in 1\u00bd cups hot water to cover. Let soak until softened, about 10 minutes.\nDrain dates and transfer to a food processor; discard soaking liquid. Add cinnamon, salt, and 2 Tbsp. oil. Pur\u00e9e, scraping down sides as needed, until smooth, about 4 minutes. (You should have about \u00bd cup pur\u00e9e.)\nGrease a 10\" cast-iron skillet with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil. Transfer dough to a clean, unfloured surface and roll out to an 8\" square. Fold in half into an 8x4\" rectangle, then fold rectangle over itself to form a 4\" square (same folding process as you did before). If dough feels tough and uncooperative, let it sit about 5 minutes to relax and try again. Roll out dough to a 12\" square about \u00bc\" thick. Dollop date pur\u00e9e all over. Using a small offset spatula, spread evenly over dough, leaving a \u00bd\" border without pur\u00e9e along edge farthest from you. Sprinkle brown sugar over pur\u00e9e.\nStarting at edge closest to you, roll up dough into a tight log. Using a sharp serrated knife and long sawing motions, trim about \u00bd\" of dough from both ends and discard. Slice log crosswise into 3 sections, wiping knife clean between slices. Slice each section crosswise into 3 buns (you should have 9 buns total that are each about 1\" thick). Transfer buns to prepared pan as you go.\nCover pan tightly with foil (or a domed lid if you have one) and place in a warm, dry spot.

Fold in half into a rectangle, then once again to make a small square. Press down on the dough with rolling pin to make it hold together. Roll dough out once more to make a rough square about \u00bd\" thick. Repeat folding process, taking your time to make it neat as this will be your final fold. Using rolling pin, gently flatten dough, rotating as needed, to make a 6\"-diameter disk.\nDust surface with more flour and roll disk into a 14\"-diameter circle or oval about \u215b\" thick. Fold dough in half, then in half again to make a rough triangle (this will make it easier to move). Slide onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and unfold. Chill while you make the filling.\nDo Ahead: Dough can be made 3 days ahead. Wrap 6\" disk tightly and chill until ready to roll out.\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 375\u00b0F. Heat 3 Tbsp. butter in a medium skillet over medium until foaming, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium-low; add onion, garlic, and 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp.

Add flour and salt; mix with a rubber spatula until a shaggy dough forms and no dry streaks remain.\nPour 4 Tbsp. oil into the biggest bowl that will fit in your refrigerator. Transfer dough to bowl and turn to coat in oil.

Pour 1 Tbsp. oil into center of pan. Keeping the dough in the bowl, gather up edges of dough farthest from you and lift up and over into center of bowl. Give the bowl a quarter turn and repeat process. Do this 2 more times; you want to deflate dough while you form it into a rough ball. (Using a fork in each hand makes this process even easier and less messy!)\nTransfer dough to prepared pan. Pour any oil left in bowl over the dough and coat it in oil. Let rise, uncovered, in a dry, warm spot until doubled in size, at least 1\u00bd hours and up to 4 hours. To see if it\u2019s ready, poke the dough with your finger.

Remove from heat and grate in garlic (use 2 cloves if you\u2019re garlic-shy or up to 4 if you love it). Return to medium heat and cook, stirring often, until garlic is just lightly toasted, about 45 seconds. Brush garlic butter all over focaccia. If you don\u2019t want to serve the focaccia immediately, hold off on brushing so it remains crisp.",

        "content": "We will be making Orange Chocolate Loaf Cake From Florida, here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['1 1/4 cups sifted all-purpose flour', '2 teaspoons baking powder', '1/4 teaspoon salt', '1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (preferably Dutch-process)', '1 cup sugar', '1 cup heavy cream', '1 teaspoon vanilla extract', '2 large eggs', 'Finely grated zest of 1 large, deep-colored orange', '1/3 cup orange juice', '3 tablespoons sugar']. Steps:Adjust rack one-third up from the bottom of the oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees. You will need a loaf pan measuring about 8\u00bd x 4\u00bd x 2\u00be inches, or one with about a 6\u2011cup capacity. Butter the pan and dust it all over lightly with fine, dry bread crumbs, shake out excess crumbs, and set the pan aside.\nSift together the flour, baking powder, salt, cocoa, and sugar and set aside.\nBeat the cream and vanilla in the small bowl of an electric mixer until the cream holds a definite shape. On low speed, add the eggs, one at a time, scraping the bowl with a rubber spatula and beating only until the egg is incorporated after each addition. (The eggs will thin the cream slightly.)\nTransfer to the large bowl of the mixer and gradually, on low speed, add the sifted dry ingredients, scraping the bowl and beating only until smooth. Remove from the mixer and stir in the grated zest. That\u2019s all there is to it.\nTurn the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake for about 1 hour and 5 minutes, until the top springs back when lightly pressed with a fingertip.\nAs soon as the cake goes into the oven, mix the orange juice with the sugar and let it stand while the cake is baking.\nAfter you remove the cake from the oven, let it cool for 5 minutes. Then, a little at a time, brush the orange juice/sugar mixture all over the cake; encourage most of it to run down the sides between the cake and the pan, but thoroughly wet the top also. The cake will absorb it all.\nLet the cake stand in the pan until it is completely cool. Then cover the pan loosely with a piece of wax paper. Invert the cake into the palm of your hand\u2014easy does it\u2014remove the pan, cover the cake with a rack, and invert again, leaving the cake right side up.",

        "content": "We will be making Whipped Cream Cake, here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['2 1/4 cups cake flour or 2 cups all purpose flour, sifted (measured by sifting into the cup and leveling it off)', '2 teaspoons baking powder', '3/4 teaspoon salt', '1 1/2 cups heavy cream, cold', '3 large eggs, at room temperature', '1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract', '1 cup plus 2 tablespoons superfine sugar', 'Special Equipment: 1 (10-cup) fluted metal tube pan', 'coated with baking spray with flour']. Steps:Twenty minutes or more before baking, set an oven rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F (350\u00b0F if using a dark pan).\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together the cake flour, baking powder, and salt and then sift them together to make the mixture easier to incorporate.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk beater, whip the cream, starting on low speed, gradually raising the speed to medium-high as it thickens, until stiff peaks form when the beater is raised.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk the eggs and vanilla just until lightly combined.\nOn medium-high speed, gradually beat the egg mixture into the whipped cream. The mixture will thicken into mayonnaise consistency (unless high-butterfat cream is used). Gradually beat in the sugar. It should take about 30 seconds to incorporate it.\nDetach the bowl and whisk beater from the stand. Add half the flour mixture to the cream mixture and, with the whisk attachment stir and fold in the flour until most of it disappears. Add the rest of the flour mixture and continue folding and mixing until all traces of flour have disappeared. Using a silicone spatula or spoon, scrape the batter into the prepared pan. Run a small metal spatula or dull knife blade through the batter to prevent large air bubbles, avoiding the bottom of the pan. Smooth the surface evenly with a small metal spatula.\nBake for 25 to 35 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted between the tube and the side comes out completely clean and the cake springs back when pressed lightly in the center. The cake should start to shrink from the sides of the pan only after removal from the oven.\nLet the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. With a small metal spatula, loosen the top edges of the cake and invert the cake onto a wire rack that has been coated lightly with nonstick cooking spray. Cool completely. The cake requires no adornment, but I love to serve it with a light dusting of powdered sugar or a large dollop of lightly sweetened Whipped Cream.",

Steps:Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0F. Lightly coat bottom and sides of a 9\"-diameter cake pan with oil. Line bottom of pan with a round of parchment paper and smooth to eliminate any air bubbles.\nGrate carrots on the large holes of a box grater. Measure out 2\u00bd cups (lightly packed; 250 g); reserve remaining carrots for another use (like raita!).\nSet a fine-mesh sieve over a measuring glass and place next to stove. Heat butter in a medium saucepan over medium until foaming, about 2 minutes. Add pistachios and cook, stirring often, until butter browns and nuts smell toasty, about 5 minutes. (Butter will get very foamy and it will be hard to see what\u2019s going on, so once the foam is golden brown, remove pan from heat every 10 seconds to check how the nuts are browning.) Pour mixture through prepared sieve, scraping in all of the browned bits; set nuts and butter aside.\nCrack eggs into a large bowl; add brown sugar, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cardamom, cinnamon, and salt. Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat 3 minutes (mixture should be thick, pale, and increased in volume). Decrease speed to medium-high and gradually stream in reserved brown butter (including browned bits); beat until combined. Coarsely chop reserved pistachios. Using a rubber spatula, fold in flour until almost completely combined, then add nuts and carrots and continue to fold until everything is incorporated. Scrape batter into prepared pan; smooth surface. Place pan on a clean smooth surface and give it a fast 360-degree spin (this pushes the batter up the sides of the pan and minimizes doming during baking).\nBake cake until deeply browned and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 50\u201355 minutes. Let cake cool in pan. Run a small offset spatula or butter knife around perimeter of cake to loosen. Place a plate upside down over cake and invert cake onto plate (leave flat side up). Remove parchment paper.\nDo Ahead: Cake can be baked 1 day ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.\nPlace a small plate in the freezer. Cook carrot juice, cream, granulated sugar, and salt in a small saucepan over high heat (do not stir) until thick like lava, 8\u201310 minutes. Mixture will initially bubble and foam vigorously and look like it\u2019s going to boil over, but it won\u2019t! Don\u2019t be tempted to reduce the heat; the bubbling will subside and mixture will thicken. You want it to be thick enough to stick to the cake, but do not let it brown. Test glaze by putting a small dollop onto the cold plate: When you run your finger through the glaze, it should leave a defined trail.\nOnce the glaze is thick enough, remove pan from heat and stir in butter. Let cool until you can comfortably hold your finger in it (if it\u2019s too hot, it will run right off the cake), about 15 minutes.\nStir glaze well and pour over center of cake, nudging to the edges with offset spatula or butter knife. Pop any air bubbles with a toothpick. Let glaze cool at least 10 minutes before slicing cake.",

Ingredients:['14 Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature', '\u00bd cup (100 g) granulated sugar', '1\u00bc tsp. kosher salt', '2 large egg yolks', '2 tsp. vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste', '2 cups (256 g) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting', 'Special Equipment: Assorted (2\") cookie cutters', '2 cups (240 g) powdered sugar, divided', '6 Tbsp. (or more) whole milk, divided', '2 tsp. (or more) any color plant-based food-coloring powder', '2 tsp. (or more) second color plant-based food-coloring powder', '\u00bc tsp. kosher salt', 'divided']. Steps:Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat butter, sugar, and salt in a large bowl, scraping down sides and bottom of bowl as needed, until light and creamy, about 3 minutes. Add egg yolks and vanilla and beat until incorporated, about 1 minute. Reduce speed to low, add 2 cups flour, and mix until incorporated. Dough will be semifirm but can be rolled out without chilling. If your kitchen is very warm and/or dough is sticky, pat it into a 1\"-thick disk, wrap in plastic, and chill 15 minutes to let firm up before rolling out.\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0F. Roll out dough on a lightly floured sheet of parchment paper, dusting with more flour as needed to keep dough from sticking, to about \u00bc\" thick. Punch out shapes as desired with lightly floured cookie cutters and transfer to 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 1\u00bd\" apart. Pat scraps into a 1\"-thick disk, wrap with plastic, and chill 10 minutes if soft.\nBake 1 sheet of cookies, rotating halfway through, until edges are golden brown, 10\u201315 minutes. Let cookies cool 10 minutes on baking sheet, then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely. Bake remaining sheet of cookies, then repeat process with remaining dough.\nDo Ahead: Dough can be made 1 month ahead; wrap tightly and freeze. Cookies can be baked 2 days ahead; store airtight at room temperature.\nWhisk 1 cup powdered sugar, 3 Tbsp. milk, 2 tsp. food-coloring powder, and half of salt in a small bowl until no lumps remain. Glaze should be the consistency of heavy cream; add more milk if needed. For a deeper color, whisk in more powder 1 tsp. at a time until desired color is achieved; adjust with milk if needed. Repeat with second food-coloring powder, remaining salt, remaining 1 cup powdered sugar, and remaining 3 Tbsp. milk, adjusting intensity of color as desired.\nSpoon 1 tsp. first glaze in the center of a small plate. Drizzle 1 tsp. second glaze over the first and use a toothpick to slightly swirl colors together; don\u2019t go overboard. (If you want to decorate larger cookies, add 1 tsp. glaze to plate for each additional inch.)\nGently press the top of a cookie into glaze, then lift up and allow excess glaze to drip back onto the plate. Using a toothpick, pop any air bubbles and swirl colors more if desired. Transfer to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with 2 more cookies, adding \u00bd tsp. of each color of glaze to plate before each cookie is dipped. The glaze will lose its swirly effect at this point. Clean plate and repeat process, decorating cookies in batches of 3 until all cookies have been glazed. Let sit until glaze is set, at least 2 hours.\nDo Ahead: Cookies can be glazed 1 day ahead. Store tightly wrapped on a rimmed baking sheet at room temperature.",

Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter, sugar, and salt in a large bowl, scraping down sides and bottom of bowl as needed, until light and creamy, about 3 minutes. Add egg yolks and vanilla and beat until incorporated, about 1 minute. Scrape in ancho mixture and beat until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Reduce speed to low, add dry ingredients, and beat to combine. Add dried fruit, chocolate, and toasted nuts and sesame seeds; mix with a wooden spoon until evenly distributed.\nDivide dough in half. Working one at a time, roll each piece into a 10\"-long log. Wrap each log tightly in plastic and roll across work surface to make as smooth and cylindrical as possible. Place on a rimmed baking sheet and freeze until surface is firm, about 20 minutes.\nSlap a log down onto counter to create a flat side; roll over and slap again to flatten another side (you\u2019re aiming for a triangular shape). Repeat to create third side of the triangle. Tap against counter to smooth if needed, then tap ends to flatten. Repeat with second log. Return logs to baking sheet; freeze until firm, about 15 minutes.\nWorking one at a time, unwrap logs and brush sides with egg white. Working on baking sheet, sprinkle sides with remaining 1 cup sesame seeds and gently press to coat. Surface should be covered; use more sesame if needed. Freeze logs on baking sheet, uncovered, until surface is very firm but not frozen solid, about 1 hour.\nPreheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Slice a log crosswise into \u00bc\"-thick triangles and divide cookies between 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 1\" apart. (If dough is soft or starts to lose its shape, freeze 10 minutes before continuing.) Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and back to front halfway through, until edges are just set, about 10 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets. Transfer cookies to a platter or airtight container and line baking sheets with fresh sheets of parchment paper. Repeat process with remaining dough.\nDo Ahead: Dough can be rolled into logs 3 days ahead; refrigerate. Transfer to freezer 30 minutes before slicing.

Combine oil and sausage with Swiss chard ribs and stems in a large skillet and set over medium-high heat. Cook, breaking up sausage with a heatproof rubber spatula or wooden spoon into small pieces, until sausage is almost cooked through, 5\u20137 minutes.\nAdd Swiss chard leaves to skillet a handful at a time, tossing and letting them wilt slightly between additions, until all the leaves have been added. Cook, reducing heat as needed (liquid should be bubbling slightly at this point), until liquid is almost completely evaporated (it\u2019s important to dry out the Swiss chard here so the filling isn\u2019t soggy), about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Let cool 5 minutes, then stir in ricotta. Season filling with salt.\nIf using pasta sheets, cook in a pot of boiling salted water 1 minute. Transfer to a large bowl of cold water. Lay out a row of pasta sheets on a rimmed baking sheet (don\u2019t overlap), then top with a sheet of waxed or parchment paper. Repeat with remaining pasta sheets, placing sheets of paper between each layer.\nIf using shells, cook in a pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, just until very al dente, about 3 minutes less than package instructions; rinse under cold water to cool quickly.\nPreheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Spread half of b\u00e9chamel into a 13x9\" baking dish. If using pasta sheets, lay out a sheet on a clean surface with a short end facing you. Spoon a heaping \u00bc-cupful of filling so it runs all the way down the center. Roll pasta around filling to create a 1 1/4\"-diameter tube (the pasta will overlap quite a bit). Repeat with remaining pasta sheets, arranging in baking dish as you go to create 2 rows. If using shells, spoon a heaping tablespoonful of filling into each shell and nestle next to each other to create rows (you\u2019ll have about 5 rows of 6 shells each). Spread remaining b\u00e9chamel over cannelloni, then marinara sauce. Top with Parmesan.\nBake cannelloni until edges of pasta are lightly browned and sauce is bubbling around edges of pan, 30\u201340 minutes.\nDo Ahead: Filling can be made 2 days ahead.

Cook on one side until almost cooked all the way through, about 5 minutes. Flip the chicken and cook on the other side for about 30 seconds, or until it is no longer pink. Transfer the chicken to a plate to rest.\nImmediately add the yellow onion and the remaining 2 teaspoons vegetable oil to the pan. Stir and cook for 5 minutes, or until the onion is dark and smells amazing but is not burnt. If it\u2019s getting too dark, lower the heat. Add the vinegar, along with the liquid that has collected on the plate where the chicken is resting, and turn the heat to low. Simmer the onion for 2 to 4 minutes, or until the liquid has evaporated. Transfer the onion to a bowl, using a rubber spatula to scrape the pan out completely. When the onion has cooled down a little, about 5 minutes, add the red onion, scallions, fried shallots, and remaining 1\u20444 teaspoon salt and stir to combine.\nMelt 2 tablespoons of the butter in the same pan. Lay out two slices of bread on your work surface and place a slice of cheese on each. Top each piece of cheese with half of the onions, two pieces of chicken, and another slice of cheese, and cover with another slice of bread. Place the sandwiches in the pan with the melted butter. Cook over medium heat, about 3 minutes, until the cheese on the bottom slice is melted and the bread is nicely toasted. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter to the pan and flip the sandwiches. Cook them for another 1 to 2 minutes, until the cheese is melted and the bottom is toasty. Remove the sandwiches from the pan, cut them in half, and insert a frilly toothpick or cocktail sword near the top in each half and serve.",

Ingredients:['1\u20443 cup (80ml) vegetable oil', '1\u20444 cup (60ml) freshly squeezed lemon juice', '1\u20444 cup (60ml) distilled white vinegar', '2 garlic cloves', '2 sprigs fresh mint', '2 sprigs fresh dill', '1\u20442 tablespoon kosher salt', '1 teaspoon low-sodium soy sauce', '1 teaspoon garlic powder', '1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper', '1\u20442 teaspoon dried oregano', '1\u20444 teaspoon red pepper flakes', '1\u20444 teaspoon ground cardamom', '1 1\u20442 pounds (680g) boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, cut into 1-inch (2.5cm) chunks', '4 super-soft hero rolls, split lengthwise', 'Shredded iceberg lettuce', 'chopped tomatoes', 'chopped white onion', 'sliced pepperoncini', 'and chopped olives']. Steps:In a blender, combine the oil, lemon juice, vinegar, garlic, mint, dill, salt, soy sauce, garlic powder, black pepper, oregano, red pepper flakes, and cardamom and puree until smooth and emulsified.\nPut the chicken in a large mixing bowl and pour the marinade over it, reserving about 1\u20442 cup marinade in a small bowl, and covering and refrigerating it. Mix the chicken well with the marinade, cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 24. The acidic marinade will start to break down the chicken, so if a more tender texture bothers you, marinate for 4 to 5 hours. I, however, am a fan of that texture and think an aggressively long, 24-hour marinade gives the chicken that much more flavor.\nHeat a grill until it is so hot you (almost) can\u2019t look directly at it. Skewer the chicken; you can make a giant skewer to save space or lots of little ones for easier turning. Cook the skewered chicken, turning three times, until nicely charred, 5 to 7 minutes on each of the four sides. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes, then take it off the skewers.\nTo serve on the rolls, top with whichever of the following makes you the happiest: lettuce, tomatoes, onion, reserved marinade, pepperoncini, olives. Or don\u2019t use any toppings, as it\u2019s meant to be eaten, in my book (which this literally is).",

Pour the cake batter directly on top of the lemon slices.\nBake for about 1 hour, until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out with only a few moist crumbs clinging to it. Transfer to a wire cooling rack and let cool for 15 minutes. Invert the cake onto a serving plate and carefully remove the parchment-paper lining. Allow the cake to cool for 1 hour more before serving.\nNote: This cake can be made with nearly any citrus, my favorite being lemon because I like it to be bitter and tart. The only citrus I would not use is raw grapefruit, oro blanco, or lime. The rinds of grapefruit and oro blanco are much thicker than lemons and oranges and they will take longer to bake. Lime and grapefruit also retain too much of the bitter quinine flavor and will make for an odd-tasting cake",

Steps:Spread the strawberries out evenly on the lined sheet pan and drizzle them with the honey. Bake for 15 minutes. Stir the berries and continue baking until they just barely begin to caramelize and get a little bit of roasted color to them, about 20 minutes more. Remove the sheet pan from the oven and let them sit until they\u2019re cool enough to handle.

Add the sugar mixture and immediately whisk vigorously until smooth. Set the pot over medium heat and cook, stirring often and adjusting the heat if necessary to prevent a simmer, until the sugar has fully dissolved, about 3 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat.\nAdd the cream and whisk until fully combined. Transfer the mixture to an airtight container and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 6 hours, or for even better texture and flavor, 24 hours. Stir the base back together if it separates during the resting time. The base can be further stored in the fridge for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 3 months. (Just be sure to fully thaw the frozen base before using it.)\nIn a bowl, combine the strawberry puree, vinegar, and black pepper with the ice cream base. Whisk as needed to get everything completely incorporated into the base. Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and turn on the machine. Churn just until it has the texture of soft-serve.\nStir the jam with a fork to loosen it. Quickly alternate spooning layers of the mixture and dollops of the jam in freezer-friendly containers.\nCover with parchment paper, pressing it to the surface of the ice cream so it adheres, then cover with a lid. It\u2019s okay if the parchment hangs over the rim. Store it in the coldest part of your freezer (farthest from the door) until firm, at least 6 hours. It will keep for up to 3 months.",

Steps:Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, then add a generous amount of salt. Cook pasta, stirring occasionally to keep it from sticking together, until just barely al dente, about 2 minutes less than package directions. Drain pasta, reserving 1 cup pasta cooking liquid.\nWhile you are cooking the pasta, get the broccoli rabe going. Heat 5 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium\u2013high.

Remove pot from heat and set aside.\nAdd pasta to reserved broccoli rabe mixture along with cream, three-quarters of the cheese, \u00bd cup chives, and reserved pasta cooking liquid; mix well. Season with salt and black pepper and add more red pepper flakes if you prefer more heat (keep in mind that the saltiness and spiciness will increase as the pasta bakes).\nTransfer pasta to a 3-qt. baking dish (or, if your Dutch oven is ovenproof, just leave it in there). Toss breadcrumbs and remaining 3 Tbsp. oil in a medium bowl until coated; season with salt and black pepper. Scatter over pasta, then sprinkle evenly with remaining cheese. Bake until pasta is bubbling across the entire surface and breadcrumbs are deep golden brown, 30\u201335 minutes. Let cool slightly.\nScatter remaining chives over pasta just before serving.",

To create your medium-heat zone, nudge the embers 2 to 3 inches lower than that.\nFill a stockpot with the water, garlic, ginger, star anise, bay leaves, and peppercorns and place over medium heat. Place the chicken, carrots, celery, and onions over high heat and cook, turning occasionally, until well charred all over, about 15 minutes total. When each ingredient is done, add it to the pot (it\u2019s important that each ingredient be very well browned\u2014almost burnt\u2014before adding to the pot). Cook the stock for at least 3 hours, adding additional water if necessary to keep the meat and vegetables covered. Season with salt at the end.\nRemove the pot from heat. Remove the chicken pieces and shred the meat, discarding the skin and bones. Strain the stock, discarding solids.\nTo serve, place a pile of shredded chicken into each bowl and cover with hot stock. Pass the parsley and lemon wedges separately. The stock can be stored in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 6 months.",

Steps:Combine all the ingredients except the salt in a food processor, add \u00bc cup water, and puree until well combined. Season with salt to taste. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to use, up to 1 week.\nIn a medium skillet, warm the olive oil over low heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until crispy and golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Strain the oil through fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, reserving the garlic chips. Use immediately or store in separate airtight containers in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.\nIn a small skillet, combine the garlic, olive oil, coriander, and salt. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook just until the garlic is fragrant, about 1 \u00bd minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool.\nTransfer the oil mixture to a blender. Add the cilantro, lemon juice, jalape\u00f1o, and \u00bc cup water and blend until smooth. If necessary, season with additional salt to taste. Use immediately or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.\nFirst, press your tofu. This procedure extracts excess water, makes the block more uniformly firm, and allows the tofu to absorb the marinade more easily. Just wrap the block of tofu in a clean kitchen towel (or paper towels), place it in a large bowl or a clean kitchen sink, and sit something heavy on top of it (like a 28-ounce can of tomatoes) for 20 minutes, turning the block over after 15 minutes.\nPlace one block of the tofu on a cutting board. Cut it in half horizontally, then cut vertically down the center to yield four pieces. Repeat with the second block of tofu.\nPour the marinade into a large baking dish, adding just enough water to ensure that it is runny, if necessary. Place the tofu in the marinade in one even layer. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight, flipping the tofu every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours. Remove the tofu from the marinade, scrape off any excess, and transfer to a large plate. Strain the marinade through a fine-mesh sieve and set aside.\nIn a large pot, bring 2 quarts water to a boil over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the salt. Blanch the collard leaves, one at a time, for 30 seconds each, then lay them flat on clean kitchen towels to dry.\nCombine the arrowroot and the remaining 2 tea\u00acspoons salt in a pie plate. Mix well. Coat each side of the tofu pieces with the arrowroot, shake off any excess arrowroot, and transfer them to a second large plate.\nLightly coat the bottom of a large cast-iron skillet with peanut oil and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add half the tofu and fry until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Gently flip each piece with a spatula and fry until golden brown on the second side. Lightly sprinkle both sides of the tofu with salt and transfer to a rack. Repeat to fry the remaining tofu. Wipe the skillet clean.\nOn a clean work surface, arrange two collard leaves lengthwise, overlapping each other by an inch or so, and place one piece of tofu in the center of the leaves. Smear 2 heaping tablespoons of the reserved marinade on top of the tofu, sprinkle a heaping teaspoon of garlic chips on top of the tofu, then fold the leaves around the tofu to create a packet. Repeat with the remaining collard leaves and tofu.\nIn the same skillet, warm 2 tablespoons peanut oil over medium-high heat, tilting the pan to coat it evenly with the oil. Place the packets in the skillet, folded-side up, and cook for about 1 minute. Gently flip each packet with a spatula, cover the skillet with a lid or some aluminum foil, and cook for about 5 minutes to warm through.\nTo serve, spread some cilantro sauce over four plates and place two of the tofu packets on each plate. Garnish with cilantro leaves and peanuts and serve.",

Steps:Heat a medium (10-inch) skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil, the onions, and 3 of the garlic cloves. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes, until the onions and garlic start to color. Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, for 25 minutes, or until caramelized.\nAdd the beans, tomatoes, thyme, the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, \u00bc teaspoon salt, and 1 cup of the water.

Season with salt and pepper, stir well, and cover with foil to keep warm.\nPreheat the broiler.\nRinse out the pan and return it to the stovetop. Add the confit duck leg skin-side down to the cold pan. Turn the heat to medium-low, add the remaining 1 tablespoon water, cover the pan, and cook for 10 minutes (when the skin softens, scrape it off the duck leg and continue cooking alongside it; this will become the crackling). Remove the lid, turn the duck leg, and continue cooking until the leg is warmed through and starting to crisp up, turning as needed.\nContinue cooking the duck skin (as if it were a slice of bacon) until nice and crisp, keeping in mind that it will crisp more as it cools (as if it were a slice of bacon), about 3 minutes longer. Drain on a paper towel.\nToast the bread on both sides under the broiler until it is crisp on the outside and still soft inside. Rub each slice generously with the remaining garlic clove and top each slice with about \u00bd cup of the beans. Shred the duck meat and divide it evenly among the toasts. Season with salt and pepper, drizzle with more oil, if desired, and crumble the crackling over the top. Sprinkle with the parsley and serve.",

        "content": "We will be making Crispy Tofu Balls, here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['1 (19-ounce) package firm tofu', '\u2153 cup finely chopped scallions', '5 \u2153 teaspoons mushroom bouillon', '4 tablespoons fresh corn, off the cob', '2 pinches ground white pepper', 'Spicy aioli, for garnish and dip', '1 cup all-purpose flour', '1 \u00bc cups water', '2 \u00bc teaspoons mushroom bouillon', '1 (12-ounce) package green glutinous rice flakes (aka com dep xanh)', '\u00bd cup cornstarch']. Steps:Pressing the tofu is the most important step, so I\u2019m going to give y\u2019all (I grew up in Texas, so I have the liberty to use \u201cy\u2019all\u201d liberally) three pressing options. The first step before you press is the same: Drain the liquid from the box of tofu. Then press.\nMethod 1: (Easiest) Use a tofu-pressing machine! I spotted one of these in Torrance, California, at a little Japanese grocery store. You place a block of tofu in between two plates and turn a small crank to compress it. Though it will press only one block at a time\u2014the boxes of tofu we use come four to a box\u2014you can set it and forget it (but do it three more times if you plan on using all the tofu).\nMethod 2: (Most common) Use two similar-size plates or relatively flat surfaces. Lay out the blocks of tofu flat in a single layer on one of the plates, and then put the second plate on top of the tofu. Press the tofu by placing at least 10 pounds of weight on top of the second plate.\nMethod 3: (Most \u201cprofessional\u201d) We still prepare the tofu this way at our restaurant, which is, without question, the most efficient way to prepare larger servings. Lay baking racks/grates inside baking sheets, then cover racks with clean (lint-free) towels or, as we did successfully for four years, with neatly folded aprons laid in a single layer as level and as flat as possible across the racks. Yup, towels or aprons, plural. Because tofu holds so much moisture, the liquid constantly spills over, and we\u2019ve found very few people who just live to clean. To absorb the moisture, and to create much less of a mess, we started using layers of cloth.\nLay out the tofu on the covered racks in a single layer, organized as tightly as possible. Make sure the tofu doesn\u2019t hang over the sides of the sheets or it won\u2019t be pressed evenly. Next, lay another towel/apron on top of the layer of tofu, again, flat and level. Then lay another equal-size baking sheet + covered rack + tofu on top of that. Repeat the same steps as needed. The top layer should be a baking sheet on which you place 30 to 40 pounds of \u201cstuff\u201d to press down on all the layers. No matter how many layers you stack, the tofu should flatten out only slightly, not be completely crushed.\nProcessing the tofu is far simpler than pressing it, though like pressing, there are three different ways to do it. Start with a bowl or a large (22-quart) plastic container made by and known as a Cambro (if you have one of those lying around), and do one of the following:\nMethod 1: Use a food mill, which is what we use. This is by far the easiest way to process tofu and get the most consistent texture (and it\u2019s a great method for mashing anything).\nMethod 2: Use a potato masher. Just mash away, but you\u2019ll still need to use the third option to smash out any little lumps that the masher doesn\u2019t, um, well, mash.\nMethod 3: Mash everything with your hands. (This is the most common way.)\nProcess the tofu until it is a consistent, almost pasty texture. If you go with No. 2 or No. 3, make sure to smash out all lumps from the tofu or else the seasoning won\u2019t evenly distribute throughout the mix and, later, the balls.\nAdd chopped scallions, mushroom bouillon, corn, and ground white pepper to the (hopefully) evenly processed tofu. Stick your hands in (maybe with gloves) and mix all the ingredients. Taste some of the mix from different areas of the bowl/container to make sure it\u2019s evenly seasoned. It should taste savory, with little bits of scallion and corn in every bite.\nNow it\u2019s ball-rolling time! Scoop out a tablespoon of the tofu mixture, hand-pack it tightly into the spoon, then level out the spoon with your finger. Assertively shake or scoop out the mix into your hand while mostly keeping it in one piece. Firmly clench the tofu by making a fist, packing it very tightly so it doesn\u2019t fall apart.\nContinue by shaping into a ball, either with one hand or by lightly tossing the ball back and forth between both hands like you\u2019re playing catch with yourself. Lightly roll the tofu between your hands, moving your hands in an alternating clockwise motion, like you would forming a meatball, only more gently to smooth out any cracks. Tofu is very docile; the more you do it, the better you\u2019ll get the feel of it (like most things in life). Place tofu balls on a plate or (ideally) a baking sheet rack.\nOptional: Refrigerate the balls overnight, uncovered. This will firm them up.\nAdd flour, water, and mushroom bouillon to a bowl. Mix together. It should not be lumpy; the consistency should be not too thin and consistently thick enough to adhere, but not so thick it doesn\u2019t drip off your finger.\nEmpty the green rice flakes into a separate bowl or catering pan, then mix in half of the dry cornstarch with flakes. Next, drop balls into flour paste. Shake off excess paste (we highly recommend using a kitchen \u201cspider\u201d strainer to do this), then roll balls around in the flakes until they\u2019re fully coated. Gently clench the balls to pack one last bit of flakes onto the balls. If flakes start to drop off the balls, mix in more of the remaining cornstarch to dry flakes, then try again.\nSet balls on a rack.\nOptional: If you plan on making more and hate waste like we do, clean and dry your hands, then sift through all the flakes. Throw out any moist clumps of flakes. Store dry flakes in a closed container, then refrigerate until your next tofu ball\u2013rolling party!\nOptional: Refrigerate the fully flaked balls uncovered (and preferably elevated on a rack) overnight. This will give the flakes more time to adhere and dry out, which is important in giving the balls more puff, crunch, and an overall prettier look after frying.\nAdd at least 2 inches of oil to a pot, bring to 350\u00b0F over high heat, then fry the balls for about 3 to 4 minutes, or until the flakes puff up bright green and any exposed tofu turns a slight golden color. If the balls start turning brown, the oil\u2019s too hot or you\u2019re frying them for too long. If the balls look oily or wet after frying, either the temperature is too low or you\u2019re frying too many balls at once, which lowers the temperature of the oil too quickly.\nRemove from oil, shake off excess, drip dry on a rack. Plate and top with spicy aioli and more aioli on the side to dip.",

Ingredients:['1 Tbsp. kosher salt, plus more', '6 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil', '\u00bd large white onion, finely chopped', '2 cups carnaroli or Japanese sushi rice', '1 cup dry white wine', '5 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces', '2 oz. Parmesan, finely grated', '\u00bc cup extra-virgin olive oil', '1 lb. mushrooms (such as shiitake, crimini, or maitake), trimmed, caps torn into (2\") pieces', 'Kosher salt', 'Freshly ground pepper', '5 sprigs thyme', '5 garlic cloves, crushed', '2 Tbsp. unsalted butter', '2 Tbsp. white wine vinegar or fresh lemon juice', '1 oz. Parmesan', 'finely grated']. Steps:Combine 1 Tbsp. salt and 10 cups water in a medium pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium to maintain a bare simmer.\nMeanwhile, heat oil in a 6-qt. Dutch oven over medium. Add onion and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring often, until onion is translucent and starting to soften, 6\u20138 minutes. Add \u00bd cup water and cook, stirring often, until water evaporates and onion is sizzling in oil and tender, about 5 minutes. Taste onion; if it\u2019s still firm at all, add a splash of water and continue to cook until meltingly soft.\nAdd rice and stir well to coat with oil. Cook, stirring constantly, until grains are translucent around the edges and make a clattering sound when they hit against the pot, about 5 minutes. (Coating grains with oil before adding any liquid helps the rice cook evenly so that the outside does not become mushy before the center is tender.) Add wine and another pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until wine evaporates, about 2 minutes.\nReduce heat to medium, then add hot salted water to rice in \u00be-cup increments, stirring constantly and allowing liquid to absorb fully before adding more, until rice is al dente and suspended in a fluid, not-too-thick creamy liquid, 25\u201330 minutes. It should take 2\u20133 minutes for each addition to be absorbed; if things are moving faster than this, reduce heat to medium-low. Gradual absorption and constant agitation are key to encouraging starches to release from risotto, creating its trademark creamy consistency. You may not need all of the hot water, but the finished texture should be more of a liquid than a solid. Start checking rice about 15 minutes after the first water addition; the grains should be tender but not mushy, with a slightly firm center that doesn\u2019t leave a chalky residue between your teeth after tasting. Do not overcook!\nRemove pot from heat, add butter, and stir until melted. Gradually add Parmesan, stirring until cheese is melted and liquid is creamy but very loose; stir in more hot salted water if needed. Taste and season with more salt.\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Add mushrooms; cook, tossing occasionally, until they begin to soften and release some liquid, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper; cook, tossing occasionally, until deeply browned and tender, 8\u201310 minutes. Add thyme, garlic, and butter and cook, tossing occasionally, until garlic softens and butter is golden brown, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and add vinegar. Toss to coat, scraping up any browned bits. Pluck out thyme.\nDivide risotto among warm bowls. Top each with a few grinds of pepper and spoon mushroom mixture over. Serve with Parmesan alongside.",

Steps:Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F and position a rack in the center of the oven. Place the walnuts on a baking sheet and toast for 8 to 10 minutes, until they start to smell fragrant and are lightly golden brown when you break one in half. Remove them from the oven and let cool. Roughly chop them and set aside.\nChop 5 ounces of the bittersweet chocolate and 4 ounces of the unsweetened chocolate into large chunks and place them with the butter in a metal or heatproof glass bowl. Set the bowl over a pot of simmering water and heat, stirring occasionally, until completely smooth. Remove from the heat, whisk in the vanilla, and let cool for about 20 minutes so it\u2019s not piping hot.\nIn a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whisk together the sugar and eggs for about 5 minutes on medium-high speed, until light and thick and pale yellow. With the mixer on low, slowly add the chocolate-butter mixture and whisk for about 15 seconds. It will not be completely mixed at this point but that\u2019s okay, because you will finish combining all the ingredients by hand.\nChop the remaining 4 ounces bittersweet chocolate into 1-inch chunks and shave the remaining 2 ounces unsweetened chocolate into fine shavings. In a medium bowl, stir together the rye flour, the chopped bittersweet chocolate, shaved unsweetened chocolate, baking powder, salt, and toasted walnuts. Remove the bowl from the mixer, add the rye flour mixture, and fold it in by hand until the dough is completely homogeneous.\nFor best results, scrape the dough into an airtight container and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 3 to 4 hours or up to overnight before baking. (The unbaked dough can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.)\nPreheat the oven to 350\u00b0F and position a rack in the center of the oven. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nDrop the dough in \u00bc-cup scoops onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, rotating the baking sheet midway through the baking time, until the cookies are just starting to crack on the edges and the centers are soft but not liquidy when you press them.\nRemove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet on a wire rack for 5 to 10 minutes, then transfer them to the rack and let cool completely.\nThe cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.",

Some may open before others\u2014remove from oven as soon as they open. Discard any oysters that don\u2019t open after 7 minutes.\nTo finish opening oysters: Fold a dish towel several times and hold oyster using towel. Slide a butter knife into opening all the way to the hinge. Turn butter knife perpendicular so top shell pops all the way open. Pull off top shell with your hand, being careful not to tip bottom shell and lose any liquid (this should all happen very easily without much force). Gently slide knife under oyster in bottom shell to release the muscle, then transfer to plate with salt.\nStir butter into reserved vinegar mixture. Spoon over oysters.",

Wrap the spinach in a clean cheesecloth or tea towel to wring out excess moisture, then roughly chop it and set it aside.\nIn a small bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and \u00bc teaspoon of the salt and set aside. In a medium nonstick skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium-low heat until a few drops of water added to the pan sizzle and evaporate. Pour in the egg mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, for 4 minutes, just until the eggs form fluffy curds but have not fully set; they should still be slightly runny. Remove from the heat and let cool in a medium bowl.\nUse your hands to gently fold the eggs, sesame oil, oyster sauce, remaining 1\u00bc teaspoons of salt, and pepper together until fully combined. Gently fold in the spinach and mix until fully incorporated.\nBring a large pot of water to a boil. Meanwhile, make the dumplings. Holding a wrapper in your palm, use a fork to add about 1 tablespoon of the filling to the center of the wrapper, then lightly pat down the filling with the fork to get rid of any air bubbles.\nFold the dumpling into the round yuan bao shape: Cradle the wrapper in your hands and fold the edge closest to you over the filling. Lightly squeeze the dumpling to push out any air bubbles. Clasp one end of the dumpling between your thumb and index finger to pinch it shut; repeat on the other side of the dumpling. Cradle the dumpling in your palms, clasping the sealed edge between your thumbs and index fingers, and squeeze it shut while pushing inward, making sure to squeeze out any air bubbles. The dumpling's belly should form a teardrop shape between your thumbs, which will create the yuan bao shape. Inspect the dumpling for any fissures that could rupture during cooking and pinch them shut. Repeat with the rest of the wrappers.\nWorking in batches, add the dumplings to the pot, 6 at a time. Boil for 2 minutes on high, then reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 1 minute, then reduce the heat again to medium and cook for 2 more minutes. The dumplings are ready a minute or so after they rise to the surface; their skins will turn puffy. Using a slotted spoon, gently transfer the dumplings to a plate and serve immediately. Bring the water back to a boil over high heat and repeat with the remaining dumplings.",

Steps:In a small bowl, soak the peppercorns in \u2153 cup of lukewarm water for at least 1 hour, then strain out and discard the peppercorns. Wrap the zucchini in a clean cheesecloth or tea towel and squeeze to wring out excess moisture.\nIn a medium bowl, add the lamb and slowly pour in the peppercorn-infused water, a few drops at a time, and use your hands to mix it in well until the water is fully absorbed. Add the scallions, wine, ginger, soy sauce, and salt, and mix well until fully incorporated.

Inspect the dumpling for any holes and pinch them shut. Repeat with the rest of the wrappers to make 24 dumplings.\nIn a small bowl, whisk together the flour, vinegar, and 1 cup of water until combined to make a slurry.

Ingredients:['2 cups all-purpose flour', '1\u20448 teaspoon kosher salt', '\u00be cup lukewarm water', '1 egg white']. Steps:Mix the Dough: Add the flour to a wide mixing bowl and stir in the salt. Stir in the water and egg white with your fingers. The flour will look shaggy, like biscuit dough; as the dough comes together, run an open palm around the edge of the bowl and fold the flour into the center, spinning the bowl with your other hand as you go, until it all forms a rough clump. It\u2019s fine if there are still pockets of dry flour.\nKnead the Dough: Coat your work surface with a fine dusting of flour and turn the dough out of the bowl. Dust your hands with flour and shape the dough into a fat log about the width of your hand. Knead the dough by pushing your hands and wrists into the log and rolling it forward. Then roll it back and push again. Repeat a few times until the log moves easily, adding more flour if it sticks, then spin the log 90 degrees, shape it into a horizontal log again, and knead a few more times, adding more flour if necessary. Use no more flour than you need to keep the dough from drying out. As you knead, the dough will get firmer and tougher with a texture reminiscent of a gummy bear. It\u2019s ready when it\u2019s smooth to the touch, like the surface of a pearl, not tacky, with no cracks or pockets of dry flour. There may be some lumps. Put the dough back in your work bowl and cover it with a sheet of plastic wrap. Let it sleep for 15 to 30 minutes. While it relaxes, you can prepare your filling.Knead Again: Dust your work surface with a little more flour, then knead it as before. Work out all those lumps; after kneading about ten times you should have satin-smooth dough that forms a clean ball you can easily push into, like the gel of a shoe insert.Portion the Dough: Form your dough into a log, dust a dough scraper with a little flour, and cut the dough into four equal sections. Roll each section into a log and chop it into six pieces for a total of twenty-four balls of dough, each about an inch in diameter. Toss the balls with a light coating of flour and cover with a lightly moistened towel.Roll the Dough Into Wrappers: Gently smash the balls of dough into flat disks, then lightly roll an Asian-style rolling pin across them to flatten them out a bit more. Hold one disk by its edge and firmly but gently roll your pin from the disk\u2019s edge to its center. Roll the same edge a few more times, using more pressure at the edge than at the center. Use your other hand to turn the dough disk and reveal a new edge of the disk; roll again. Continue until all edges are rolled out and the wrapper is about 3 to 4 inches in diameter. Hold your rolled-out wrapper up to a light. If you can see through it faintly, your wrapper is ready to go. Otherwise, keep rolling. Roll the edges to half the thickness of the center of the wrappers. As you get faster, you\u2019ll notice that all your active hand needs to do is roll the pin back and forth while your other hand just rotates the wrapper. As long as your hands stay in these fixed motions, you\u2019ll easily make even, round wrappers though they don\u2019t need to be perfectly uniform. Place freshly rolled wrappers under a lightly moistened towel to keep them from drying out.",

Steps:Cut the chilled butter into very small pieces. Mix the flour, cornmeal, and sea salt in a food processor; add the butter, and pulse until the mixture is a sandy texture that resembles breadcrumbs. Transfer to a bowl, and add half the Parmesan cheese, mixing with a fork or knife until combined. (Reserve remaining cheese for topping the pie.) Measure out 4 tablespoons of ice-cold water, and add to the flour mixture a little at a time until the dough sticks together, mixing just long enough to create a mass. Do not overmix. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or place in a plastic bag; hold it in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes. Remove one hour before use to bring to room temperature.\nHeat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat. Add half the garlic, onion, bell pepper, Scotch bonnet pepper, thyme, and scallion; cook for about 5 minutes until soft. Add the callaloo and cook down for about 8 minutes, until it turns bright green. Stir in 1/4 cup heavy cream. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\nHeat 1 tablespoon olive oil in another saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat, and add the remaining garlic, onion, bell pepper, Scotch bonnet pepper, thyme, and scallion; saut\u00e9 for about 1 minute. Add the plantain and cook, stirring occasionally, for another 5 minutes. Add the corn and cilantro, and saut\u00e9 for another minute. Add 1/4 cup heavy cream, and season to taste with salt and pepper.\nMelt 1 tablespoon butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon chopped scallion. Add the white wine, and cook, stirring, until the wine is evaporated. Stir in the heavy cream and whole milk. Bring to a simmer. Allow to simmer for about 5 minutes, until the sauce is reduced. Stir in the thyme and Parmesan cheese.\nPreheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. On a lightly floured surface, roll out two-thirds of the pastry into a large circle, and use it to line the base and sides of an 8-inch pie dish or casserole. Layer half the plantain mixture in the bottom, then distribute half the mozzarella and a sprinkle of Parmesan on top of that. Cover with half the callaloo mixture, then half the goat cheese and more Parmesan. Repeat the layers in the same order with the remaining plantain filling, mozzarella, Parmesan, callaloo filling, goat cheese, and more Parmesan. Pour the sauce over the assembled pie.\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll out the rest of the pastry into an 8-inch round; lay it on top of the pie, trimming away any excess pastry and crimping the edges to seal well. Score an X in the middle of the top crust with a sharp knife. Brush the top of the pie with the beaten egg, scatter with the rest of the Parmesan, and chill for at least 20 minutes. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes until the pastry is golden-brown on top. Allow to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before serving.",

Steps:To make the filling, in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, warm 2 Tbsp [30 ml] of the oil. Stir in the onion, lower the heat to medium, and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 4 minutes. Stir in the beans, salt, and pepper and cook until the beans absorb some of the seasoning and are hot all the way through, about 2 minutes. Turn off the heat.\nUsing a potato masher or an immersion blender, mash the beans in the pot to make a paste. Mash in the cilantro and dill and let cool to room temperature.\nCut the lavash into 12 strips 3 in [7.5 cm] thick and about 12 in [30.5 cm] long. Keep cut lavash covered or in a plastic bag so the strips don\u2019t dry out.\nTo shape each triangle, position a strip of lavash in front of you vertically. Place about 2 Tbsp of bean paste at the bottom end of the strip. Pull the bottom left corner of the strip to the right side, about 3 in [7.5 cm] up from the bottom, to create a triangle that encases the beans. Next, take the bottom right corner of the triangle and fold it away from you to the left edge of the lavash to enclose the filling, \u201crolling\u201d the triangle up the lavash and adding a layer to the triangle. Continue to fold the triangle all the way up the strip until all of the lavash is used up. If any extra lavash hangs off the edge, trim it with scissors. Once finished, place the triangle seam-side down and repeat with the remaining strips and filling.\nLine a plate with paper towels. Heat 2 Tbsp of oil in a large saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat. Place half of the triangles seam-side down in the oil and fry until golden brown on one side, about 1 minute, adjusting the heat as needed to prevent the lavash from burning. Flip the triangles over to brown the other side, 30 seconds to 1 minute more. Transfer to the paper towel\u2013lined plate and repeat with the remaining oil and triangles. If the pan seems too dry after flipping over the triangles, add more oil. Let cool slightly before serving.

        "content": "We will be making Malaysian Chicken Curry with Buttermilk Beer Beignets, here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['1 \u2153 tablespoons Yeo brand Malaysian curry powder', '1 teaspoon sugar', '1 teaspoon kosher salt', '1 teaspoon chicken bouillon', '1 pound dark meat chicken (cut, uncut, bone-on, boneless)', '\u2154 cup coconut milk', '2 \u2154 tablespoons whole milk', '2 \u00bd teaspoons sambal badjak (an Indonesian chili paste with minced onions and dried shrimp)', '\u00bc yellow or white onion, sliced', '2 makrut lime leaves, ripped in half widthwise', '\u2153 pound Okinawan sweet potatoes (aka Hawaiian purple sweet potatoes), peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes', '\u2153 pound carrots, cut into 1 \u00bd-inch-long pieces', 'Buttermilk Beer Beignets (optional)', 'Scallions', 'coarsely chopped', 'for garnish']. Steps:Combine curry powder, sugar, salt, and chicken bouillon in a mixing bowl and hand mix together until it\u2019s all one love, one mix.\nRinse chicken under water, pat dry with paper towels, then transfer to a mixing bowl. Next, pour the beautiful curry spice mix all over that chicken. Mix and rub the spices all over the chicken until no chicken remains uncovered with spice. Cover it all up, like it\u2019s your only goal in life.\nMarinate overnight. Alternatively, if you\u2019re in a hurry, marinate for 1 hour, though the curry mix won\u2019t fully penetrate the chicken or touch the souls of others, which is what eating is all about.\nWhen ready to cook, you\u2019ll need a pan to saut\u00e9 with and a pot for stewing and braising.\nCombine coconut milk, whole milk, and sambal badjak in pot.\nNext, heat the saut\u00e9 pan to medium-high heat. Add a little bit of cooking oil, add some onions and some lime leaves, and sear batches of chicken until chicken turns golden brown all around, while sweating onions and leaves. Do not cook the chicken through; just brown and sear. The lime leaves will fill your kitchen with their incredible citrus scent\u2014a pretty amazing smell.\nAfter each batch is evenly seared, transfer into pot. To ensure the chicken cooks evenly, do not heat up the pot until all chicken is seared. Continue searing onions, lime leaves, and chicken. Once all chicken is seared, saut\u00e9 any remaining lime leaves, and onions, and transfer to the pot before cooking. If there is any excess spice mix in the chicken marinade bowl, also transfer into the pot because the spice mix is measured specifically to give the best flavor for the curry sauce itself and not just the marinade.\nBring pot to a boil over high heat, then simmer covered with a slight opening for 35\u201345 minutes, or until the chicken is tender but not falling apart. The curry consistency should be thin and almost milky. Once chicken is done, turn off heat.\nWhile waiting for the chicken to finish cooking, prepare an ice water bath in a bowl. Bring 2 inches of water to a rolling boil in a pot over high heat. Cook the sweet potatoes in the boiling water for 6\u20138 minutes. Check often to see when the potatoes are cooked through; they should be crunchy, still firm and not mushy. Once they\u2019re done, remove the potatoes from pot (but do not dump the boiling water; save it for blanching the carrots) and shock them immediately in the ice water bath for 2 minutes, or until they are completely cool to the touch. Strain and set aside cooked potatoes in a fresh bowl.\nNext, blanch the carrots by repeating the steps as for the potatoes, checking for nonmushy doneness. If you use baby carrots, they take about 4\u20135 minutes to blanch. Adjust time accordingly for the type of carrots you\u2019re using and how they\u2019re cut. Cook, shock, strain, then set aside with the potatoes.\nChicken can be served immediately, but it will be most flavorful if cooled down, stored, and covered overnight in the fridge, and then reheated and served the next day. Blanched potatoes and carrots can also be stored overnight.\nWhen ready to serve (not long before\u2014just right when you are ready to serve), add carrots and potatoes to the hot chicken curry. Garnish with scallions. Serve with steamed rice, and if you want to soak up that curry deliciousness (my favorite part), sop it up with some Buttermilk Beer Beignets.\nAnd that\u2019s the best experience with chicken curry that you can have\u2014reaching the epitome of chicken curry enlightenment. Enjoy, kids!",

Steps:Preheat oven to 250\u00b0F. Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat egg whites, cream of tartar, and salt in a large bowl until foamy and the yellowish tinge has disappeared, about 2 minutes. With the motor running, add granulated sugar about 1 Tbsp. at a time until mixture is very stiff and shiny, about 5 minutes.\nTransfer meringue to a piping bag fitted with a 1/2\" round pastry tip (or a freezer bag with a 1/2\" opening cut from one bottom corner). Pipe 12 mounds ranging in size from 1\"\u20131 1/2\" in diameter for the mushroom caps on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Pipe 12 cones straight up about 1 1/2\" high for the mushroom stems. With a lightly damp finger, tamp down points on rounds. Sprinkle rounds with cocoa powder. Pipe extra tops and stems with remaining meringue as backups.\nBake meringues until dry and set, about 2 hours. Open oven door 10 minutes to release any steam. Turn oven off, shut door, and let meringues dry out completely, about 2 hours longer or up to overnight.\nWhen ready to assemble, melt chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl in microwave, stirring every 10 seconds, until melted, about 20 seconds. Using an offset spatula, release meringues from parchment. Using a paring knife, make a small hole in the center of flat side of each mushroom cap. Spread some chocolate on flat side, then stick top of stem into hole. Return to parchment and repeat with remaining tops and stems. Let mushrooms stand at room temperature until chocolate is firm.\nCombine pistachios and milk in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until pistachios are very tender, about 20 minutes. Remove and skim off any loose pistachio skins.\nMeanwhile, sprinkle gelatin over 2 Tbsp. water in a small bowl and let stand 5 minutes.\nTransfer pistachio mixture to a food processor and blend until smooth. Return mixture to saucepan and whisk in egg yolks, granulated sugar, and salt. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring, until mixture begins to thicken but do not let boil, 3\u20135 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in gelatin mixture and almond extract. Transfer to a small bowl and let cool.\nWhisk egg whites, granulated sugar, and salt in a large heatproof bowl. Set bowl over a pot of simmering water (do not let bowl touch water) and cook, whisking constantly, until mixture becomes fluffy and opaque and you can\u2019t feel any grains of sugar when you rub mixture between two fingers, about 5 minutes. Remove bowl from heat.\nMelt chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl in microwave, stirring every 20 seconds, until melted, about 1 minute. Let cool slightly.\nUsing an electric mixer on high speed, beat egg white mixture until cool, glossy, and fluffy, about 10 minutes. (A stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment makes this job much easier!) Add butter one piece at a time, beating until fully incorporated before adding the next, until fluffy and smooth, another 4 minutes. If mixture looks curdled, switch to the paddle attachment and/or apply a little bit of heat to underside of bowl with a washcloth dipped in hot water and continue to beat until smooth. Beat in chocolate and vanilla extract until combined.\nDo Ahead: Frosting can be made 3 days ahead. Transfer to an airtight container and chill. Bring to room temperature and beat to desired consistency.\nPlace a rack in center of oven; preheat to 375\u00b0F. Grease an 18x13\" rimmed baking sheet with oil. Line with parchment paper and grease parchment.\nUsing electric mixer on high speed, beat egg yolks and 1/4 cup water in a large bowl until doubled in size and thick and fluffy, about 5 minutes. With the motor running, gradually add 1 cup granulated sugar, a little at a time, until mixture is very thick. Beat in vanilla.\nSift flour, baking powder, salt, and 1/4 tsp. cardamom over egg yolk mixture and fold gently to combine (it will be very thick).\nUsing electric mixer on high speed, beat egg whites and cream of tartar in another clean large bowl until foamy and the yellowish tinge has disappeared, about 1 minute. Beat in 1/2 cup granulated sugar, about 1 Tbsp. at a time, until shiny, medium stiff peaks form. Fold about one-quarter of egg white mixture into egg yolk mixture to loosen. Fold remaining egg white mixture into egg yolk mixture until combined.\nTransfer batter to prepared pan; smooth top. Bake cake until puffed and set and springs back when gently poked in the center, 15\u201320 minutes. Transfer cake to a wire rack and let cool 5 minutes.\nSet a clean dish towel on a work surface and dust completely with powdered sugar. Cut around edges of cake with a sharp paring knife. Invert cake onto prepared towel; remove parchment. Without squishing the cake and starting on long side, gently roll up cake in towel. Transfer cake to a wire rack and let cool completely.\nWhile cake cools, make the brandy syrup. Cook remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar and 1/4 tsp. cardamom with 2 Tbsp. water in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in brandy. Let cool.\nMelt chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl in microwave, stirring every 20 seconds, until melted, about 1 minute. Using an offset spatula, spread melted chocolate across a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Sift cocoa over and freeze bark until solid, about 10 minutes.\nGently unroll cake. With a pastry brush, evenly brush with brandy syrup until all syrup is absorbed. Spread filling evenly over cake and roll it back up without towel.\nTransfer to a platter. Trim ends. Cut off about 3\" from both ends on a diagonal. Place angled side of each small piece against roll to create branches, positioning one on top and the other on the side, using a large dab of frosting to adhere. Cover any exposed cake on sides with more frosting.\nBreak chocolate bark into long shards and press into cake in a decorative pattern. Top and surround cake with meringue mushrooms. Use pistachios to create \u201cmoss\u201d on and around log. Dust with powdered sugar.",

Thaw and/or stir before use.\nEven though some of the spices are already ground, we will process them a second time to get a finer powder that will stick well to the chickpeas. In a spice grinder, grind the spice mix ingredients to a fine powder. Set aside.\nIn a deep frying pan or Dutch oven, pour enough oil to reach a depth of 2 inches (5 cm). Heat over medium-high until the oil bubbles up immediately around an inserted wooden chopstick.\nMeanwhile in a large bowl, toss the chickpeas with the buttermilk and the 1 tablespoon of flour until they are evenly coated in this light batter. In a separate large bowl, mix the remaining cup (31 g) flour, the garlic powder, baking soda, white pepper, and salt. Add the coated chickpeas to the flour mixture and toss until you have a slightly wet but crumbly mixture. It may look like the chickpeas are kind of sticking together, but it\u2019s okay.\nIn a large bowl, mix the garlic with 2 teaspoons of the Garlic Confit Sauce (save the rest for another day). Set aside.\nNow, in several small batches as needed, add the breaded chickpeas to the hot oil and start breaking them apart with a chopstick. It\u2019s okay if they are in small clumps of 2 to 4 chickpeas. Fry for a couple of minutes, until the chickpeas are golden brown all around. Transfer with a slotted spoon to the bowl with the garlic sauce and repeat to fry the rest of the chickpeas.\nAdd the basil leaves to the frying oil and immediately cover the pot with a lid, leaving a small slit for the steam to escape. When the popping sound has subsided, remove the lid and fry the basil until crispy. Transfer with a slotted spoon to the bowl with the chickpeas.\nToss the chickpeas to coat them evenly with the garlic mixture, then add the spice mixture and toss until evenly coated. Season with more salt if needed. Serve immediately.",

        "content": "We will be making Pandora\u2019s Box, here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['1 vanilla bean', '2 cups (480 mL) whole milk', '1 tablespoon loose chamomile tea', '5 large egg yolks', '1/4 cup (60 mL) honey', '1/4 cup (50 g) granulated sugar', '5 tablespoons (39 g) all-purpose flour', '1 tablespoon custard powder (find online, or replace with another 1 tablespoon flour)', '4 tablespoons (1/2 stick/54 g) unsalted butter', '1 approximately 11-inch (28-cm) loaf Hokkaido milk bread or rectangular brioche', '3/4 cup (180 mL) whole milk', '1 large egg', '2 tablespoons light brown sugar', '1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon', '1/8 teaspoon salt', 'Granulated sugar, for coating', 'Unsalted butter, for frying', 'Tart berries\u2014raspberries', 'strawberries', 'blueberries\u2014to sprinkle on top']. Steps:Split the vanilla bean in half lengthwise, then scrape out all the seeds. Combine the pod, seeds, and milk in a medium saucepan and set it over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally to prevent scalding. When it is almost at a simmer, turn off the heat. Place a sieve over the saucepan so that it dips into the milk but doesn\u2019t sink to the bottom, then add the chamomile tea. Let steep for 5 minutes.\nIn a medium bowl, using a handheld mixer or whisk, whisk the egg yolks, honey, and sugar until thick and velvety, about 2 minutes (you should see ribbons fall from the whisk). Add the flour and custard powder, then whisk until lump-free. Remove the chamomile and vanilla pods from the milk, then slowly pour 1/2 cup (120 mL) of the hot milk into the yolk mixture, whisking constantly until combined. Add the yolk mixture back to the pan, then set it over medium-low heat. Whisking constantly, let the mixture bubble gently until you have a thick custard (take the pot off the heat and whisk to blend if lumps start forming on the side of the pan). Turn off the heat and whisk in the unsalted butter, one tablespoon at a time, until evenly incorporated. Let cool slightly, then transfer to an airtight container and chill in the fridge for at least 6 hours or up to overnight. The custard can be made a couple of days ahead.\nWith a serrated knife, remove the crust from the bread on all sides, then cut the loaf into two 5-inch (13-cm) cubes. Try to keep the edges as straight as possible.\nIn a large bowl, whisk the milk, egg, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt. On a rimmed baking sheet, scatter a thin layer of granulated sugar. Working one at a time, dip the bread cubes in the milk mixture for just a couple of seconds on each side, then place them on a baking sheet. With a spoon, scatter a generous but even layer of granulated sugar over each side (you need a good coating to get that hardened caramel shell).\nSet a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat and add enough butter to thinly coat the surface. Use a flat spatula to gently place the coated bread cubes in the skillet, then fry on each side until the sugar is golden brown and caramelized. If you see burned sugar in the skillet as you cook, remove it with a spoon. Keep adding more butter as needed.\nLet the cubes cool slightly on a cooling rack (the caramel needs a couple of minutes to harden). They can be made 15 minutes before serving but no longer. Right before serving, cut out a 2-inch (5-cm) hole on one side of each cube, then remove about half of the bread from the interior (chopsticks are perfect for this job). Using a piping bag or plastic bag with a cutout hole, squeeze the chilled custard inside to fill the cavity up to the top. Sprinkle with tart berries (I used blueberries because that was what I had, but more sour berries like raspberries or strawberries would work better) and a bit of powdered sugar. Dig in.",

Ingredients:['8 large portobello mushrooms', '2 garlic cloves, diced', '1 teaspoon thyme leaves', '2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil', '100g (3 \u00bd ounces) spinach', '1/8 teaspoon nutmeg, grated', '1 tablespoon Marsala', '3 egg yolks, beaten', '320g (about 11 oz.) ready-rolled puff pastry sheet', '1 teaspoon black onion seeds', '100g (1/2 cup) butter', '2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil', '4 white onions, sliced', '1 teaspoon thyme leaves', '2 garlic cloves, sliced', '1 tablespoon Marsala', '3 eggs', '100g (about \u00be cup) all-purpose flour', '300ml (1 \u00bc cups) whole milk', '1 teaspoon chopped rosemary', 'Sunflower oil, for frying', '2 tablespoons olive oil', '2 shallots, diced', '2 garlic cloves, diced', '1 teaspoon chopped thyme leaves', '50ml (about 1/4 cup) dry sherry (Manzanilla or Fino)', '200ml (about 3/4 cup) vegetable stock', '250ml (1 cup) heavy cream', 'Steamed broccolini and kale']. Steps:Wipe the mushrooms with a piece of damp paper towel to remove dirt and grit; twist out and discard the stalks. Place in a large roasting tray with the garlic, thyme, Marsala, oil and salt and pepper. Rub each mushroom with the garlicky oil and cover the tray with tin foil. Place in an oven heated to 180\u00b0C (350\u00b0F) for 15 minutes, until the mushrooms have reduced in size and are soft throughout. Remove the foil, drain away the cooking liquid and set the tray on a cool surface while you prepare the rest of the Wellington.\nFor the onions, melt the butter with the oil in a medium frying pan over a medium heat. When all the butter has melted, add the onions with a pinch of salt and cook, stirring regularly, until the onions turn soft and translucent. Add the thyme, garlic and Marsala to the pan and continue to cook for a further 15 minutes, stirring every 2 minutes until the onions are golden and caramelized all over. Remove the onions from the pan to a plate lined with paper towels to drain away the excess oil and butter. Leave to cool completely.\nNext, make the pancakes. Whisk the eggs with the flour in a large mixing bowl, then slowly pour in the milk, whisking all the time until no lumps are visible. Add the chopped rosemary and season with salt and pepper. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside for 10 minutes until bubbles appear on the surface of the batter.\nWarm a 26 cm. (10 in.) non-stick frying pan with a splash of sunflower oil over a medium-high heat. Pour half a ladle of the pancake batter into the pan and swirl to evenly coat the base.\nCook each pancake for a minute on each side, until lightly golden, then flip and cook the other side. The mixture should produce 6-8 thin pancakes.\nCook the spinach for a minute with a pinch of salt and a grating of nutmeg in a frying pan until bright green and just wilted. Squeeze out as much moisture as you can through a sieve, then dry on kitchen paper.\nLay out a 30cm (12 in.) piece of plastic wrap on a clean work surface, then lay 4 cooled pancakes alongside each other on the plastic wrap (you can use any extra when making the Wellington), ensuring a generous amount of overlap so that there is a continuous length down the middle of the plastic wrap. Brush the pancake all over with some of the egg yolk, then arrange the spinach down the middle of the pancakes, leaving a couple of centimeters at each end without spinach.\nPlace the mushrooms on top of the spinach, placing one on top of the other, giving four layers of two down the center. Top the mushrooms with the caramelized onion mixture, then use the plastic wrap to lift the pancake over the filling on either side. Fold over the ends and continue rolling until you have a tight cylinder shape. If there are any gaps, use the extra pancakes to patch up, brushing with egg yolk as you go. Wrap the pancake tightly with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for 20 minutes.\nRoll out the sheet of puff pastry and brush with egg yolk. Remove the chilled pancake cylinder from the fridge and unwrap the cling film. Place in the middle of the puff pastry sheet and fold the pastry over the filled pancake to encase it completely. Crimp the sides of the pastry and brush with egg yolk all over. Scatter over the black onion seeds and cook in an oven heated to 180\u00b0C (350\u00b0F) for 25-30 minutes, until dark golden all over.\nWhile the Wellington is cooking, make the sauce. Heat the olive oil in a small saucepan over a medium heat, then add the shallots and garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 5 minutes, until soft and translucent. Add the thyme and dry sherry and bring to the boil. Reduce for 3 minutes, then add the stock. Continue to cook until the liquid has reduced by half, then add the heavy cream and turn the heat to low. Cook for 5 minutes, then season with salt and pepper.\nServe the Wellington with the tarragon cream sauce in a jug for pouring over and steamed broccolini and kale on the side.",

Steps:In a 4-quart saucepan, combine the rice, chicken stock, and water. Cover and let sit overnight at cool room temperature (around or below 60\u00b0F) or in the refrigerator.\nThe next morning, add the ginger and the white parts of the green onions to the pot. Partially cover (a small gap is perfect to minimize evaporation and avoid a boil over) and bring to vigorous simmer over high heat. Lower the heat and gently simmer, partially covered, for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally and adjusting the heat as needed. When done, most of the liquid will have been absorbed (you\u2019ll see little separation between the rice and liquid). Discard the ginger and green onions. Stir the pot, cover tightly, turn off the heat, and let rest for 10 minutes to finish thickening. The desired thickness of the porridge can vary according to taste; it can be rustic and thick, or elegant and thin, or somewhere in between. If needed, add a splash of water to thin or cook a little longer to thicken. Taste and season with the salt.\nWhen ready to serve, reheat the porridge to a simmer, then ladle into individual bowls. Garnish with sliced green onions and pepper.\nLean, light-tasting ch\u00e1o responds well to fatty, salty, spicy, herbal enhancements. In addition to (or instead of) garnishing your porridge with green onion and pepper, consider the following, and feel free to mix and match.\nCrisp chopped bacon, a fried or soft-boiled egg, and maybe chopped kimchi for punch.\nLemongrass Tempeh Crumbles or Crispy Caramelized Pork Crumbles.\nChopped Sriracha Tofu, fried onions or shallots, and coarsely chopped fresh cilantro, mint, or basil.\nCrack a raw egg into the bowl before ladling in the hot soup. Top with crumbled rice crackers and perhaps ribbons of Korean toasted seaweed snacks (one pack of gim is enough for a batch). Stir well before eating.\nDrop 8 ounces of raw peeled shrimp into the soup as it heats. When the shrimp are pink and cooked through, ladle out the soup.

Steps:Place all the stage 1 ingredients in a 300ml (\u00bd pint) jar or container with a lid, mix, cover and leave at warm room temperature for 4\u20136 hours.\nPlace the stage 2 ingredients plus 125g (4 oz) of the starter in a large bowl, stir well with a whisk, cover and leave in a warm place for 1\u20132 hours or more time if it suits you. It won\u2019t rise much but you should see some bubbles as evidence of fermentation on the surface of the mix.\nIn the hour before you plan to do the final mix and bake, melt the butter and chocolate in a small heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water. Set aside to cool for 30 minutes. Line a 25cm (10 in) square tin with baking parchment.\nPreheat the oven to 160\u00baC/325\u00baF/gas mark 3.\nAdd the melted chocolate and butter plus the remaining stage 3 ingredients into the bowl with the batter. Whisk until well combined. Pour into the lined tin and smooth the top with the back of a spoon so it is evenly distributed.\nBake for 30-40 minutes until the top looks dry but it still has a slight wobble. It\u2019s difficult to overbake these. Sprinkle with additional sea salt, if liked, after they come out of the oven and leave to cool in the tin. When cool cut into squares to serve. The brownies can be stored in an airtight container for up to a week.",

        "content": "We will be making Lavash, here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['\u00bd cup [70 g] all-purpose flour', '\u00bc cup plus a scant 1 Tbsp [70 ml] lukewarm water', '\u00bc tsp instant yeast', '1 cup [240 ml] lukewarm water', '1 Tbsp sunflower oil or other neutral oil', '2 tsp kosher salt', '3 cups plus 2 Tbsp [440 g] all-purpose flour', 'plus more for dusting']. Steps:To make the old dough, using your hands or a rubber spatula, squish together the flour, water, and yeast in a bowl until it forms a thick paste. Scrape the paste into a small, lightly oiled container, cover, and let it sit out for 1\u00bd to 2 hours, or refrigerate overnight and bring to room temperature for at least 2 hours before using. When ready, the ball will have doubled in volume.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the old dough, water, oil, and salt. Squish the old dough with your hands to break it up in the water; it doesn\u2019t have to be perfectly mixed in.\nFit the stand mixer with the paddle attachment and add a third of the flour. Mix on low speed until the dough looks like pancake batter. Add the remaining flour and mix on low speed until incorporated. Remove the paddle attachment, pulling off any dough stuck to it. If there is flour at the base of the bowl, use your hands to press the dough into the flour. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let the dough sit for 20 minutes to allow the flour to hydrate.\nRemove the towel and attach the dough hook to the stand mixer. Mix the dough on medium speed until the dough releases from the sides of the bowl without sticking and feels smooth to the touch, about 4 minutes. Turn the mixer off and reposition the dough to the center of the bowl if it seems to get stuck on one side of the bowl.\nCombine the old dough, water, oil, and salt in a large bowl and mix together, squishing the old dough into the water with your hands. Stir in the flour gradually with your fingers until a crumbly dough forms, then knead it a few times in the bowl by folding the dough over itself and pressing it down into the bowl. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let the dough rest for 20 minutes.\nDust the counter lightly with flour and place the dough on top. Begin kneading by stretching and folding the dough over itself until it is smooth to the touch, 5 to 7 minutes.\nLightly oil an 8 cup [2 L] glass Pyrex or a large glass bowl and place the dough inside. Cover the bowl with a lid, a plate, or plastic wrap, and let it rest for 3 hours or until doubled in volume. Or refrigerate overnight and let the dough come to room temperature for at least 2 hours before portioning.\nTo portion and shape the dough, dust the counter lightly with flour and place the dough on top. Using a bench scraper or knife, cut the dough into eight pieces about 3.5 oz [100 g] each.\nTo shape the dough, cup the palm of your hand over one portion at a time and move your hand in a circle. The friction from the counter will help form the dough into a ball. If there is too much flour on the surface and the dough is sliding around, give the counter a spritz of water and try again. Lightly oil a rimmed tray and place the dough on the tray, ensuring that the portions are not touching. Cover with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap lightly coated with oil. Leave out for 1 to 1\u00bd hours, or until puffy, or refrigerate for up to 3 days. If you refrigerate the dough, use plastic wrap to cover it and expect it to take an hour or two to return to room temperature before it is ready to be rolled out.\nDust the counter lightly with flour. Pat a portion of dough into an oval with your fingertips. Using a rolling pin and moving back and forth, roll the dough as thinly as possible into an oval about 13 by 9 in [33 by 23 cm]. If the dough resists stretching, let it relax and start working on another portion before returning to it. You can also gently stretch the dough with your hands to correct the shape. It doesn\u2019t have to look perfect.\nPlace a carbon-steel wok upside down over a burner. Have a pair of tongs handy.\nHeat the wok over high heat for 1 minute or until a sprinkle of water instantly evaporates.\nDrape the dough over the wok. Cook for 1 minute or until you can lift it easily from the wok with tongs and it has puffed slightly and blistered. Turn the dough over to briefly cook the other side, no more than 30 seconds. For extra browning, flip it over for another 30 seconds.\nTransfer the lavash to a half-sheet pan and cover with a dry kitchen towel while you cook the rest of the dough. In between batches, turn off the burner. The wok heats up quickly, and it will get too hot if the burner is left on.\nPlace a 20 in [50 cm] cast-iron griddle over two burners. Heat the griddle over medium-high heat for a few minutes or until a sprinkle of water instantly evaporates.\nDrape the dough over the griddle. Cook for 1 minute or until you can lift the dough easily with tongs and it has puffed slightly and blistered. Turn the dough over to briefly cook the other side, no more than 30 seconds. For extra browning, flip it over for 30 more seconds.\nTransfer the lavash to a half-sheet pan and cover with a dry kitchen towel while you cook the rest of the dough. In between batches, keep the griddle turned on, but monitor its heat so it doesn\u2019t get too hot.\nHave tongs, a pastry brush, a small bowl of vegetable oil, and 2 half-sheet pans ready. Coat one of the pans lightly with oil.\nHeat a gas grill over medium-high heat or prepare a charcoal grill for direct-heat cooking. Ensure that the grill grates are clean. The grill should be hot enough that you can only hold your hand over the grates for 3 to 5 seconds. Place a sheet of dough onto the oiled pan and brush oil on top. Drape the oiled dough over the grill. Cover the grill and cook for 25 seconds. Uncover the grill. Using tongs, turn the lavash over and let it cook for another 25 seconds, uncovered, or until evenly blistered and puffed in parts.\nTransfer to the clean half-sheet pan and cover with a dry kitchen towel while you cook the rest of the dough.\nEat the lavash soon after making it or store it in plastic bags to keep the bread pliable. It\u2019s okay if it dries out and turns brittle; just rehydrate it by misting the lavash with water and covering it with a towel to let it soften. Soon after, it should be pliable enough to roll up without cracking. If it\u2019s still cracking, mist with more water.",

Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt, divided', '1\u00bd cups whole pecans', '1 Tbsp. pure maple syrup', 'Whipped cream (for serving; optional)']. Steps:Whisk rye flour, sugar, salt, and 1\u00bd cups all-purpose flour in a large bowl to combine. Add butter and toss to evenly coat. Working quickly and aggressively, use your fingers to rub butter into flour to create large shaggy pieces of dough (you want some pieces of butter that are flat and thin and some that are large and chunky). Drizzle 5 Tbsp. ice water over, running your fingers through flour mixture to evenly distribute. Knead dough in bowl until it starts to come together (it should look a little dry, but add more ice water by the teaspoonful if needed, just until dough comes together).\nTurn dough out onto a work surface and knead 1 or 2 more times, pressing to incorporate shaggy edges and any loose bits. Dust surface and dough lightly with flour to keep dough from sticking. Using your hands, form dough into about a 7x5\" rectangle. Using your rolling pin, gently tap and press dough to compact and tidy up edges. Roll out dough, dusting dough and surface as needed, until 3 times longer than when you started. Fold dough over onto itself in thirds like a letter to make a square. Wrap in plastic and chill until firm, at least 30 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface to about a 12\" round. Wrap dough around your rolling pin and unfurl into a standard 9\"-diameter pie dish. Gently lift dough so it slumps down into edges of dish. Trim overhang and crimp as desired. Line crust with parchment paper or foil. Place dish on a rimmed baking sheet and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until edges of crust start to brown, about 20 minutes. Remove parchment and weights. Decrease oven temperature to 350\u00b0 and bake crust until edges are golden, 20\u201325 minutes. Remove dish from oven and brush 1 Tbsp. egg white over bottom of crust. Return to oven and bake until crust is golden brown, 5\u201310 minutes (the egg creates a water-resistant coating that helps prevent the custard from making the bottom soggy). Reserve remaining egg white for topping.\nDo Ahead: Dough can be made 3 days ahead; keep chilled. Crust can be baked 3 days ahead; store tightly wrapped at room temperature.\nWhile your crust is baking, combine eggs, egg yolk, pie filling, cream, granulated sugar, whiskey, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cardamom, cloves, 6 Tbsp. brown sugar, 2 Tbsp. butter, and \u00bd tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bc tsp. Morton kosher salt in a large bowl and blend with an immersion blender until smooth; try not to aerate. (Alternatively, you can whisk mixture well and blend in 2 batches in a blender until smooth and homogenous.)\nPour into crust and bake pie (still at 350\u00b0F) until filling is puffed and mostly set with just a slight wobble in the center when gently shaken, 40\u201345 minutes.\nJust before the pie is done baking, toast pecans on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until slightly darkened and fragrant, 8\u201310 minutes.\nWhisk reserved egg white, remaining 2 Tbsp. brown sugar, and remaining \u00be tsp. salt in a small bowl until foamy, about 30 seconds. Add syrup and remaining 1 Tbsp. butter; whisk just to combine. Add pecans and toss to coat.\nCarefully remove pie from oven and top with pecan mixture, allowing any excess egg white mixture to drip back into the bowl. Return pie to oven and bake until filling is completely set (a tester or paring knife inserted into the center should come out clean) and nuts are not tacky to the touch, 8\u201310 minutes. Transfer pie to a wire rack and let cool, at least 2 hours. Serve with whipped cream if desired.\nDo Ahead: Pie can be baked 1 day ahead. Store uncovered in a cool oven or at room temperature.",

Morton kosher salt', '2\u2154 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting', '1\u00bd cups (3 sticks) chilled unsalted butter', 'cut into \u00bd\" pieces']. Steps:Whisk sugar, salt, and 2\u2154 cups flour in a large bowl. Add butter and, using your fingers, smash each piece into a thin disk. Take your time doing this and don\u2019t feel compelled to break butter into even smaller pieces. Drizzle \u2154 cup ice water over, dispersing it as widely as possible, and mix with a rubber spatula to bring mixture together into a shaggy mass.\nTurn dough out onto a surface and work together with your hands, pushing and flattening until dough holds together when squeezed in your palm but some streaks of dry flour are still visible. Divide dough into 2 portions.\nFlatten 1 portion of dough into an 8\"-diameter disk. Cut into quarters, stack pieces on top of one another, and flatten dough with a rolling pin to about half of its original height. At this point dough should hold together with no dry spots remaining, and have nice big flakes of butter showing. Use a bench scraper or a large knife to clean any clingy bits of dough from surface. Dust surface with flour, then dust top of dough with flour. Roll out to a \u00bc\"\u2013\u215c\"-thick round. Wrap dough around rolling pin and transfer to a standard 9\"-diameter pie dish. Unfurl into dish, then lift edges and allow dough to slump down into dish. Trim overhang to an even 1\" (there will be some excess). Fold overhang under and crimp as desired. Cover and chill until very cold, at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours (cover tightly if chilling longer than 1 hour). Repeat process with remaining dough and another pie dish. Or form into a 1\u00bd\"-thick disk, wrap in plastic, and chill up to 3 days (or freeze up to 1 month).\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Lay 2 sheets of parchment paper over dough and fill with pie weights or dried beans (they should fill the dish). Set on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet (this will keep any butter drips from smoking up your oven). Bake until edges are golden brown and bottom is opaque (carefully lift parchment to check), 30\u201335 minutes. Remove from oven; reduce oven temperature to 300\u00b0F. Lift out parchment and weights. Bake crust until evenly chestnut brown all over, 10\u201315 minutes. If baking both crusts, turn oven dial back up to 400\u00b0F and let oven preheat; repeat with remaining crust.",

Bake until golden brown, 12\u201315 minutes. The crust will most likely have slumped down toward the bottom of the dish; remove from oven and press crust back up the sides while still hot. Return to oven and bake until browned, about 5 minutes longer. Let cool.\nDo Ahead: Crust can be made 3 days ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.\nWhisk granulated sugar and cornstarch in a large saucepan to combine. Add eggs and egg yolks and whisk vigorously, making sure to get into corners of pan, until smooth and pale. Whisk in milk, vanilla, and \u00bd tsp. salt.\nPlace saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer, whisking often and making sure to get into corners of pan, 8\u201310 minutes (mixture should be bubbling and thickened). Reduce heat and continue to simmer, whisking constantly, 3 minutes. Let pudding cool 5 minutes, whisking every minute.\nAdd butter to pudding and whisk until melted and fully incorporated. Add bananas and stir once to incorporate. Scrape filling into cooled crust; smooth surface. Chill until cold and set, at least 2 hours and up to 1 day.\nUsing an electric mixer, beat cream, powdered sugar, and a pinch of salt in a large bowl until soft peaks form. Spoon whipped cream over filling, swirling as desired. Top with peanuts.",

Steps:Place turkey, breast side up, on a cutting board and pat dry. Grip a wing and pull it outward so you can see where it attaches to the body. Using a sharp boning or chef\u2019s knife, cut though the joint to separate the wing from the breast (if you hit bone, you\u2019re in the wrong spot; pull the wing out farther to help you get into the place where the joint meets the socket). Remove wing; repeat on the other side.\nCut through skin connecting 1 leg to carcass. Pull leg back until the ball joint pops out of its socket; cut through the joint to separate leg. Repeat on the other side.\nNow for the breast: Position the turkey breast side down with the opening facing you. Using kitchen shears, cut along one side of backbone until you get all the way through the neck end, then turn the turkey 180\u00b0F and cut through the other side to remove the backbone (save it for making stock).\nVery finely grind black and pink peppercorns in a spice mill or mortar and pestle; transfer to a medium bowl. Add salt, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and 1 Tbsp. brown sugar and use your fingers to mix together.\nPlace turkey pieces, skin side up, on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle salt mixture liberally all over turkey, patting to adhere. You may not need all of it, but it\u2019s good to have extra since some will end up on the baking sheet. Chill bird, uncovered, at least 24 hours and up to 2 days.\nRemove turkey from wire rack and rinse baking sheet and rack if needed (turkey will most likely release some liquid). Line baking sheet with 3 layers of foil to make cleanup easy and set rack back inside. Arrange turkey pieces on rack, skin side up, and let sit at room temperature 2\u20133 hours to help decrease the cooking time.\nMeanwhile, cook herbs, garlic, orange zest, soy sauce, vinegar, and remaining \u2153 cup brown sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved and glaze thickens slightly (it should just barely coat a spoon), 10\u201312 minutes. Remove glaze from heat.\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 425\u00b0F. Rub turkey with oil and pour 1 cup water into baking sheet. Roast turkey, rotating baking sheet halfway through, until skin is mostly golden brown, 20\u201325 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 300\u00b0F and continue to roast turkey, brushing with glaze every 20 minutes and adding more water by \u00bd-cupfuls as needed to maintain some liquid in baking sheet, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 150\u00b0F, and 170\u00b0F when inserted into the thickest part of the thighs, 50\u201370 minutes longer (total cooking time will be 1\u20131\u00bd hours). Skin should be deep golden brown and shiny. Transfer turkey to a cutting board; tent loosely with foil. Let rest 30\u201360 minutes before carving.",

Steps:Put the butter and sugar into the bowl of a stand mixer and refrigerate until the butter is firm, approximately 30 minutes.\nMeanwhile, heat the oven to 350\u00b0F and spread the wheat germ onto a half sheet (13 by 18-inch) pan. Toast until slightly aromatic, approximately 3 minutes. Cool to room temperature.\nIn a bowl, whisk together the flours, salts, and toasted wheat germ. Remove the bowl from the refrigerator. Fit the mixer with the paddle attachment. Add the flour mixture to the butter and sugar and mix on low speed until the dough starts to resemble a coarse meal, 6 to 8 minutes. Increase the speed to medium and mix until the dough just starts to clump around the paddle or to the sides of the bowl, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer. With a plastic bench scraper, bring the dough completely together by hand.\nPlace the dough on a surface lightly dusted with flour. Roll the dough back and forth into a cylinder. Using your fingers, pat the dough into a rectangle. Put a sheet of parchment paper the same dimensions as a half sheet pan on the work surface and dust lightly with flour. Put the dough on top.\nUsing a rolling pin, begin rolling out the dough. If any cracks form in the dough, stop to push them together. To keep the dough from sticking to the parchment paper, dust the top lightly with flour, cover with another piece of parchment paper, and, sandwiching the dough between both sheets of parchment paper, flip the dough and paper over. Peel off the top layer of parchment paper and continue to roll. Roll the dough into a 10 by 12- or 14-inch rectangle approximately \u00bc inch thick. If the surface is uneven, roll a pastry roller across the surface to even it out.\nEase the dough and parchment paper onto a half sheet pan. Cover with another piece of parchment paper and refrigerate until firm, at least 20 minutes. Heat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Line a couple of half sheet pans with parchment paper.\nLet the dough sit at room temperature for up to 10 minutes. Invert the dough onto a work surface and peel off the top sheet of parchment paper. Roll a dough docker over the dough or pierce it numerous times with a fork.\nUsing a 1 \u00be by 2 \u00bd-inch (or comparable) cookie cutter, cut out the shortbread. Reroll the dough trimmings, chill, and cut out more cookies. If you don\u2019t have a comparable cookie cutter, you can cut out the rectangles with a knife.\nEvenly space 12 to 16 shortbreads on the prepared pan. Place the pan in the oven, lower the temperature to 325\u00b0F, and bake for 10 minutes. Rotate the pan and bake until the cookies feel firm to the touch and are slightly brown around the edges, 6 to 8 minutes more. Let the cookies cool entirely on the sheet pan. Repeat with the remaining dough.\nThe cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week. Dough can be refrigerated for up to 1 week.",

Bake the cookies just until they are firm and turning golden brown at the edges but still very soft in their centers, about 12 minutes, rotating the sheets from front to back and top to bottom about halfway through the baking time. As soon as the cookies come out of the oven, reinforce the indentations with whatever tool you used before. Let the cookies cool for 5 minutes on the pans, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.\nPlace the chocolate and butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on HIGH in 30-second intervals, stirring well, until smooth. Let cool slightly. Transfer the ganache to a small resealable plastic bag and work it toward the corner of the bag. Snip off a tiny bit at the corner of the bag with scissors. Fill each divot with ganache. Let the cookies rest at room temperature until the ganache is firm, about 1 hour, or refrigerate to set in about 30 minutes. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.",

Steps:Pulse granulated sugar, salt, and 1 1/4 cups flour in a food processor to combine. Add butter and pulse until coarse, pea-size crumbs form, about 10 seconds. With the motor running, add 2 Tbsp. ice water and process until dough just holds together, about 30 seconds. Squeeze a small amount of dough between your fingers: If it\u2019s very crumbly, pulse in more ice water 1 Tbsp. at a time (2 Tbsp. maximum). Do not overprocess.\nTurn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and push together into a ball. Knead a few times to combine, then flatten into a disk with smooth edges (no cracks). Cover tightly and chill at least 1 hour.\nRoll out dough to a 13\" round on a lightly floured surface. Roll dough loosely around rolling pin and transfer to a standard 9\"-diameter pie dish. Lightly press dough into pan, leaving a 1\" overhang; trim excess. Fold overhang under and crimp as desired. Chill until cold, about 30 minutes.\nDo Ahead: Dough can be made and shaped into disk 3 days ahead. Keep chilled, or freeze up to 3 months. Thaw before rolling.\nPlace racks in bottom third and center of oven; preheat to 375\u00b0F. Place a rimmed baking sheet on bottom rack to preheat.\nSpread hazelnuts on another rimmed baking sheet and bake on center rack until light golden brown, about 10 minutes. Reserve 1 cup whole hazelnuts to decorate pie; finely chop remaining hazelnuts.\nMelt chocolate in a small heatproof bowl set over a small saucepan of barely simmering water (do not let water touch bowl); stir constantly until chocolate is melted and smooth. (You can also do this in a microwave.) Remove from heat and let cool slightly. Spread chocolate in bottom of pie shell with the back of a spoon and chill until set, about 15 minutes.\nMelt butter in a small skillet over medium heat or in a microwave in a microwave-safe bowl. Pour butter into a large bowl. Whisk in brown sugar, espresso powder, vanilla, 1 cup corn syrup, and 3/4 tsp. salt until well incorporated. Whisk in eggs, then fold in chopped hazelnuts.\nPour filling into pie crust (do not overfill). Toss whole hazelnuts with remaining 2 Tbsp. corn syrup and 1/4 tsp. salt in a small bowl and arrange on top of pie. Place pie dish on preheated baking sheet on bottom rack and bake 20 minutes. Rotate baking sheet, move to center rack, and continue to bake, covering edges with foil or a pie shield if crust starts to brown too much, until crust is golden brown and filling is almost set with a slight jiggle in center of pie, 20\u201325 minutes more. Transfer pie to a wire rack and let cool before slicing, about 3 hours.\nDo Ahead: Filling (before decorating) can be made 1 day ahead. Bring to room temperature before baking. Pie can be made 2 days ahead. Cover loosely with foil and store at room temperature.",

Steps:Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 325\u00b0F. Grease a 9x5\" loaf pan with vegetable oil, then line with parchment paper, leaving overhang on long sides. Oil parchment paper (for insurance and an easy release).\nPulse pistachios in a food processor until finely ground (it\u2019s okay if some of the pieces are a bit larger). Set aside a heaping tablespoonful.\nWhisk lemon zest, flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, salt, and remaining pistachios in a large bowl. Whisk olive oil, 2 Tbsp. lemon juice, remaining \u2153 cup vegetable oil, and \u00bd cup water in a small bowl to combine. Pour oil mixture into dry ingredients and fold with a rubber spatula to combine, being very careful not to overmix (this batter contains a high ratio of liquid, which means it can get gummy if overworked). Pour into prepared pan and tilt to distribute; batter should come halfway up the sides.\nBake cake until golden brown all over, it springs back when gently pressed, and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 50\u201360 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool completely in pan, at least 2 hours. Using parchment overhang, lift cake out of pan and place on rack. Peel away parchment.\nWhisk powdered sugar and 3 Tbsp. lemon juice in a medium bowl, drizzling in remaining 2 Tbsp. lemon juice as needed until you have a thick but pourable glaze. Pour glaze over cake, letting it drip down the sides. Immediately top cake with reserved pistachios, then let sit until glaze is set, at least 30 minutes.\nDo Ahead: Cake can be made 3 days ahead.

Steps:Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F.\nUsing a small paring knife, make a few \u00bd-inch slits into the cut side of each eggplant. (You can do this lengthwise, crosswise, or even diagonally. Knock yourself out with your decorative prowess!)\nPlace the eggplant cut side up on a rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with \u00bd cup olive oil, distributing as evenly as possible. Season with salt and pepper and turn over so that the eggplant is cut side down.\nPlace in the oven and roast, without moving or disturbing, until eggplant is completely tender, cooked through, and golden brown on the bottom (since the skin is already so dark, it can be hard to tell, but the skin will look shriveled and, when poked, the whole thing should feel tender, on the verge of collapse; you can also use a spatula to lift up the eggplant to check the underside for color), 40 to 45 minutes.\nMeanwhile, heat the remaining \u00bc cup olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and chile and cook, shaking the skillet occasionally, until the garlic and chile are frizzled and fragrant (but not yet browned), 1 or 2 minutes. Add the bread and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until the bread is evenly toasted and golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.\nCombine the labne, preserved lemon, and 1 tablespoon lemon juice in a small bowl; season with salt, pepper, and more lemon juice, if you like. Smear it onto the bottom of a large serving platter or in a shallow bowl.\nOnce the eggplant is good and ready to go, use a fish spatula (or regular spatula) to lift up each eggplant half in one fell swoop, preserving its lovely golden underside. Place the eggplant, cut side up, on top of the seasoned labne. Scatter with the crispy croutons and herbs before serving.\nEggplant can be roasted a few hours ahead, then kept loosely covered at room temperature (no need to reheat\u2014 it\u2019s excellent at room temperature). The labne can be seasoned a week ahead, covered tightly, and refrigerated. The croutons can be made 2 days ahead, kept covered tightly at room temperature.",

Remove the bag with the chicken from the refrigerator. Pour the contents into a colander in the sink and rinse. Transfer the chicken, garlic, and thyme sprigs to an 8 by 8-inch baking dish with fairly high sides, or a Dutch oven, so that the chicken sits in one layer. Spread the sliced onion on top and pour in the oils, until the chicken is completely covered. Bake for 6 hours, or until the onion has caramelized and the chicken is super tender and delicious and falling off of the bone. Carefully pull the dish out of the oven to cool for an hour, then remove the chicken and strain the fat into a clean lidded jar (it\u2019ll keep in the fridge for months). Shred the cooked chicken and set aside on a large plate.\nTo make the noodle salad, in a bowl, toss the rice noodles with the herbs, 1\u20442 cup of the reserved confit fat, and the salt.\nHeat 2 teaspoons of the confit fat in a large nonstick pan over high heat until it just starts to smoke. Add the shredded chicken confit and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the meat is browned, crispy, and insanely fragrant. Divide the noodle salad among eight bowls and top with the saut\u00e9ed confit and some pickled tomatoes, and serve.",

Steps:Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F.\nCut the very tops (about 1 inch) off the onions and then replace. Make a bed of coarse salt in a small roasting pan. Place the onions on the salt and roast for about an hour, or until soft through.\nWhen cool enough to handle, scoop out the insides of the onions, leaving the outer two layers intact within the skin. Take care not to scrape out the base of the onions, as the fonduta will leak out the bottom. Finely chop half of the onion innards for the filling. Set aside.\nIn a medium-size saut\u00e9 pan, heat the olive oil and add the sliced pine mushrooms. Sweat for 5 minutes, then add the flour. Saut\u00e9 for 1 minute more, then add the Vegetable Stock and cream. Bring to a simmer and add the reserved chopped Walla Walla, thyme, and salt and pepper to taste. Add the day-old sourdough bread pieces. Cook together for 5 minutes to meld the flavours. Add the grated Gruy\u00e8re, stirring to melt, then remove f rom the heat.\nPreheat the oven to 450\u00b0F. Place the Roasted Walla Walla Onions in a roasting pan, and fill with hot Pine Mushroom Fonduta (if you have extra, it can be served on the side). Top with the grated Gruy\u00e8re. Roast for 10 minutes, until bubbly.\nServe with lots of Arctic Sourdough and any extra fonduta that didn\u2019t fit in the onions.",

Steps:Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Line a standard cupcake pan with twelve paper baking cups, and a second pan with six baking cups, or grease pans with butter if not using baking cups.\nSift together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt on a sheet of parchment paper or wax paper and set aside.\nPlace the butter in the bowl of a stand mixer or in a bowl with a handheld electric mixer. Beat on medium speed until fluffy. Stop to add the sugar; beat on medium speed until well incorporated, approximately 3 to 5 minutes.\nAdd the eggs one at a time, mixing slowly on medium speed, after each addition. It\u2019s important to add them one at a time so that they will completely incorporate into the batter and you don\u2019t put too much weight on your batter at once. This would collapse all the little air bubbles you created when you creamed the butter and sugar.\nReduce the speed to low. At this stage, it\u2019s always important to mix as slowly and as little as necessary since you don\u2019t want to traumatize your batter. Add one third of the flour mixture to the butter mixture, then gradually add one third of the hot water, beating until well incorporated. Add another third of the flour mixture, followed by one third of the hot water. It\u2019s important to add the flour and water little by little like this, so that your batter does not have too much weight thrown on it and that you allow each amount of flour and water to completely mix into the batter. Stop to scrape down the bowl as needed. Add the remaining flour mixture, followed by the remaining hot water, and beat just until combined.\nUsing a spatula, fold the grated apple into the batter. Take care not to overmix the batter. If you overmix the batter, the cupcakes will not be light and fluffy but instead very dense.\nUse a standard-size ice-cream scoop to fill each baking cup with batter, so the cups are two-thirds full. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes (start checking at 15 minutes) or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean. After 5 minutes, transfer the cupcakes to a wire rack to cool completely for approximately 20 minutes. It\u2019s always best to cool the cupcakes at room temperature. Putting them in the refrigerator to cool can dry out the cake.\nPlace all ingredients in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment; beat until well combined. Be sure to beat on high speed at the very end for at least 2 minutes to ensure that the frosting is light and fluffy.\nPour the sugar and water into a large saucepan. Heat on medium-high heat and stir constantly until the sugar completely liquefies. Stir constantly and be careful not to burn the sugar. After all the sugar has dissolved, add the butter and vanilla extract to the saucepan and mix thoroughly. Once the butter has melted and the butter and sugar are completely mixed, remove from heat and, using a whisk, slowly whisk in the heavy cream until you reach a beautiful golden brown caramel color. Set aside and let cool and thicken for 5 minutes at room temperature. Refrigerate for 20 minutes to thicken further before you use to fill or decorate.",

For thinner-skinned turnips, a good scrubbing will do.\nCut the roots into chunks; I like them about 1 inch thick and 2 inches long. Cut the round roots through the equator and chunk them up from there. For sweet potatoes, cut them in half lengthwise, then again lengthwise, and then into 2-inch pieces. If you can find baby sweet potatoes, just cut those in half. There\u2019s no wrong way to do this; just keep all of your vegetables similar in size and shape so they cook evenly.\nPreheat an ovenproof saut\u00e9 pan large enough to hold the root vegetables in one layer over medium-high heat. Add the rice bran, grapeseed, or olive oil and continue heating until the oil shimmers and is thinking about smoking. Carefully add the roots and let them caramelize on one side, 2 to 3 minutes. Check to make sure they\u2019re not burning\u2014lower the heat if they\u2019re scorching in some spots. Give the roots a toss in the pan (tongs work, too) and season with the salt, sugar, and pepper. Add the thyme and rosemary and transfer the pan to the oven.\nCook until the vegetables are lightly browned and tender. Start checking with the tip of a sharp knife after 6 minutes and continue to check every 5 minutes. They\u2019re done when they\u2019re easily pierced all the way through. The beets will cook in about 30 minutes, the turnips in just 10 minutes or less, and the sweet potatoes in 20 minutes. This will depend on the age, variety, and cut of the vegetable, so use your senses (including common sense) and check often.\nSpoon the roasted vegetables into a large bowl. Discard the herb stems. Add the orange juice or vinegar, extra-virgin olive oil, and chile flakes. Toss until well coated.\nYou can serve at this point, or store in the fridge for up to 5 days.",

Steps:In a large bowl, combine the cheese, olive oil, lemon zest and juice, garlic, honey, salt, chile flakes, and pepper. Add the kale and toss to combine\u2014really get in there and work the kale with your hands; this isn\u2019t a gentle massage. Set the kale aside to marinate at room temperature for 2 hours or in the fridge overnight. Alternatively, you could toss the kale in with the just-roasted, marinating beets along with the cheese, olive oil, et al., and let the mixture sit at room temperature for 2 hours or in the fridge overnight. They\u2019ll marinate just the same.\nCombine the hazelnuts, hazelnut oil, vinegar, shallot, thyme, honey, salt, and pepper in a small jar with a tight-fitting lid and shake it until the dressing comes together. Set aside until ready to serve or store in the fridge for up to 5 days.\nPreheat a large cast-iron pan over high heat for 5 minutes. When the pan looks very hot (you see little wisps of smoke), add the marinated beets and char on one side for 1 minute, just long enough to get some char. Remove the beets from the pan and add the kale, again charring for 1 minute. You are looking to just heat the kale, not fully cook it. You also could do this over the high heat of a grill. Remove the pan from the heat.\nSpread the cheese over a large platter. Season it a bit with salt and pepper. Scatter the charred kale and beets over the cheese, douse with the hazelnut vinaigrette, and finish with the chopped hazelnuts",

Ingredients:['1 1/2 tsp. sugar', '3/4 tsp. kosher salt', '1 1/3 cups (180 g) all-purpose flour, plus more for surface', '3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) chilled unsalted butter']. Steps:Whisk sugar, salt, and 1 1/3 cups flour in a medium bowl. Cut butter into 6 rectangular pieces (if using 1/2-cup sticks, cut them in half crosswise, then in half again lengthwise). Toss butter in dry ingredients to coat, then dump mixture out onto a work surface. Roll butter into flour until it is in long flexible strips, using a bench scraper to scrape butter off rolling pin or surface as needed.\nUse bench scraper to gather mixture into a loose pile, then drizzle 4 Tbsp. ice water over. Using your hands and the bench scraper, toss mixture until water is distributed, then gather into a rectangular pile. Roll out dough to a long rectangle with short ends about 8\" wide, then use bench scraper to fold dough into thirds, like folding a letter. It will be very crumbly and loose; don\u2019t panic. Using bench scraper to help, turn rectangle 90\u00b0 and repeat rolling and folding, gathering loose bits of dough from outer edges into the center and flouring surface as needed. Repeat rolling and folding a third time. Dough should be somewhat homogenous and creamy-looking with some dry bits around edges. Squeeze a bit in your palm; it should loosely hold together. If not, repeat rolling and folding. Wrap folded dough in plastic, then press it into a compact disk about 1\" thick. Chill 30 minutes.\nRoll out dough on a lightly floured surface to a 12\"\u201314\" round or oval about 1/8\" thick (don\u2019t worry about cracks around perimeter). Dust surface and rolling pin with flour as needed and rotate dough often to prevent wider cracks. If dough sticks to surface, lift on one side and scatter flour underneath before continuing. Roll dough onto your pin, then unfurl it on a sheet of parchment paper. Slide onto a rimmed baking sheet and chill while you prep the filling.\nDo Ahead: Dough can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled, or transfer to a resealable plastic bag and freeze up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before rolling out.",

Pack the fish in the rest of the salt-sugar-shiso mixture and cover loosely with a large piece of plastic wrap. You need to weight down the salmon, which you can go about in a couple different ways: A) If you have a dish or container that is slightly smaller than the one the salmon is sitting in, set the smaller container on top of the fish and weight it down with a few cans or a brick; B) Alternatively, fill a large zip-top bag three-quarters full with cold water and seal. Nestle the bag over the piece of fish. If the bag hangs over the sides of the baking dish, pour out some of the water and reseal. In either case, wrap the whole apparatus tightly in plastic wrap and allow the fish to cure in the refrigerator for 1 day.\nAfter a day, unwrap the fish and flip it over, being sure all the flesh comes into contact with the curing mix (which should be mostly liquid at this point). Weight the fish down again and wrap it again in fresh plastic. Cure in the fridge for 3 or 4 more days, depending on the thickness of your fillet. The gravlax is ready when the fish is firm to the touch.\nWipe the cure off the salmon and wrap it in clean plastic wrap. Refrigerate until ready to serve. It will keep for up to a week.\nPulse the dried onion in a food processor or spice grinder five times, or until powdery. Transfer to a bowl, add the remaining ingredients, and stir well. Store in an airtight container for up to a couple weeks. Give it a good shake before serving.\nWorking in batches, use a mortar and pestle, food processor, or spice grinder to pulverize the katsuobushi flakes into a fine powder. Transfer to a bowl, add the remaining ingredients, and stir well. Store in an air-tight container for up to a week.\nSet out a spread of the sliced bagels and toppings and let people do as they please.",

Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until light and airy, about 2 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to medium-low and add the eggs one at a time, mixing well between each addition and scraping down the side and bottom of the bowl as needed. Once all 3 eggs are added, beat for 1 minute on medium speed to get the mixture nice and fluffy.\nReduce the speed to medium-low and add the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk mixture in three batches, starting with the flour. Add the melted chocolate and mix on medium speed until well incorporated, stopping the mixer to scrape down the side and bottom of the bowl as needed.\nUse a rubber or offset spatula to scrape the batter into the prepared pan and even it out as much as possible. Bake until a cake tester inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean and the center of the cake resists light pressure, about 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool completely, at least 2 hours, before frosting.\nMake the frosting: Put the butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or in a medium bowl, if using a handheld mixer). Beat on medium-high speed until smooth. Turn off the mixer and sift the confectioners\u2019 sugar into the bowl and combine on low speed. Add the melted chocolate, soy sauce, and vanilla and beat on low speed until combined.

Toast, stirring constantly, until golden brown, about 5 minutes.\nTransfer the crumbs to a medium bowl. Chop the cooked bacon very finely. Add it to the crumbs and toss well. Season with cayenne, salt, and pepper. There should be about 1 3/4 cups. Set aside.\nFor the eggs, bring water in a medium saucepan to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Add the salt. Fill a medium bowl with ice water and set aside.\nPoach 4 eggs at a time. Crack 1 egg into a small cup or saucer. Hold the cup in the simmering water and slip the egg in. Repeat with 3 more eggs. Slip a spatula under the eggs, giving them a gentle nudge, to keep them from resting on the bottom of the pan. Poach the eggs until the whites turn opaque but the yolks remain soft, 2\u20133 minutes. Lift the eggs from the pan with a slotted spoon or spatula into the bowl of ice water to quickly stop the cooking. Meanwhile, poach the remaining 4 eggs.\nWhen the eggs are cold, set them on paper towels to drain. Trim off any ragged egg whites to tidy up the egg into a neat shape. Gently pat the 8 eggs all over with paper towels so they are dry for coating.\nPut the flour in a medium bowl. Beat the remaining 3 eggs with 1 Tbsp. water in another medium bowl. Arrange 3 bowls as follows: flour\u2013eggs\u2013crumbs. Working with 1 poached egg at a time, gently dredge in flour; next gently roll in beaten eggs, covering it completely; then dredge in the crumbs.

Ingredients:['2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting', '2 1/4 tsp. kosher salt, divided', '3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces', '1 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar', '1 1/2 lb. heirloom tomatoes, sliced 1/4\" thick', '2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced', '4 oz. firm cheese (such as Asiago, cheddar, or Gouda), finely grated (about 1 1/2 cups)', '1 large egg, beaten to blend', 'Flaky sea salt', 'Freshly ground black pepper', '1/2 lemon', '1 Tbsp. finely chopped chives']. Steps:Pulse 2 cups flour and 1 1/4 tsp. kosher salt in a food processor to combine. Add butter and pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal with a few pea-size pieces of butter remaining.\nTransfer mixture to a large bowl; drizzle with vinegar and 1/4 cup ice water. Mix with a fork, adding more ice water by the tablespoonful as needed, just until a shaggy dough comes together. Turn out onto a work surface and lightly knead until no dry spots remain (be careful not to overwork). Pat into a disk and wrap in plastic. Chill at least 2 hours.\nPreheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Gently toss tomatoes, garlic, and remaining 1 tsp. kosher salt in a large bowl. Let sit 5 minutes (tomatoes will start releasing some liquid). Drain tomato mixture and transfer to paper towels.\nUnwrap dough and roll out on a lightly floured sheet of parchment paper to a 14\" round about 1/8\" thick. Transfer on parchment to a baking sheet. Scatter cheese over dough, leaving a 1 1/2\" border. Arrange tomatoes and garlic over cheese. Bring edges of dough up and over filling, overlapping as needed to create about a 1 1/2\" border; brush dough with egg. Sprinkle tomatoes with sea salt and pepper. Chill in freezer 10 minutes.\nBake galette, rotating once, until crust is golden brown and cooked through, 55\u201365 minutes. Let cool slightly on baking sheet. Finely grate zest from lemon over galette; sprinkle with chives.\nDo Ahead: Dough can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled.",

Ingredients:['2 medium red bell peppers', '1 1/4 cups extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling', 'Kosher salt', '1 large onion, thinly sliced', '1 1/2 lb. German Butterball potatoes (about 6), peeled, sliced 1/4\" thick', '8 large eggs']. Steps:Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Place bell peppers on a rimmed baking sheet, drizzle with oil, and turn to coat. Season with salt. Roast peppers, turning every 5 minutes, until softened and skins look wrinkly and lightly blistered, 20\u201325 minutes. Let cool slightly. Peel and remove seeds from bell peppers, then cut flesh into 1/2\"-thick slices. (You should have about 1 cup.)\nMeanwhile, toss together onion and potatoes in an 8\" cast-iron skillet; season with salt. Cover with 1 1/4 cups oil and set over medium heat. Bring to a gentle simmer, about 3 minutes, and cook, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon and scraping the bottom of the pan to minimize sticking, reducing heat if needed, until there is no crunch left to the onion (do not let it take on any color) and the potatoes are tender, 25\u201330 minutes. Taste a piece of potato and onion to check. Some of the mixture may stick to the pan, and some of the potatoes may break into smaller pieces toward the end of cooking\u2014both of these things are okay. Transfer to a medium bowl; let cool until warm, 8\u201310 minutes. Stir in roasted peppers.\nClean skillet and place in oven to heat. Whisk eggs in a medium bowl until no streaks remain; season with salt. Using a slotted spoon or tongs, lift vegetables out of the oil and add to eggs (this is best done while they are still warm). Set onion-potato oil aside.\nTransfer skillet to stovetop and continue to heat over high until ripping hot, about 5 minutes. Add 3 Tbsp. reserved onion-potato oil to pan, then pour in egg mixture. Cook, using a heatproof rubber spatula or wooden spoon to pull egg mixture from the outer edges into the center, allowing uncooked egg to flow underneath and dragging the hotter, more-set egg from the edges into the center. This will help frittata cook evenly. Transfer skillet back to the oven and bake the frittata until browned and set, 10\u201314 minutes. Let frittata cool in pan 5\u201310 minutes, then invert onto a platter and cut into wedges to serve.\nDo Ahead: Bell peppers can be roasted 2 days ahead; cover and chill. Remove from refrigerator when you start prepping other ingredients so that they\u2019re not fridge-cold when you combine them with the eggs.",

Steps:Stir saffron and 2 Tbsp. lukewarm water in a small bowl; set aside to bloom.\nMeanwhile, place rice in a strainer or fine-mesh sieve and rinse with lukewarm water, swishing around with your hands to get rid of excess starch, until water runs clear. Cook rice in a large pot of boiling generously salted water for 7 minutes. Check one grain; it should be soft on the edges but firm inside. You should be able to break it into two using your fingertips, but the grain should still be firm in the middle. If not, cook 1 minute longer and check again. Drain rice and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking.\nWipe out pot. Pour 1/3 cup oil into pot and heat over medium. Add saffron mixture, tilting pot to make sure it covers the bottom.\nArrange potato slices in an even layer in bottom of pot. Season with 2 tsp. salt. Return rice to pot on top of potatoes in a mound (so it\u2019s higher in the middle than the edges) without pressing or packing it down. Using the handle of a wooden spoon, make 5 holes in rice, going all the way down to the potato layer, so steam can escape. Pour 1/2 cup water around outer edge of potatoes. Cover lid with a clean dish towel, tying the ends up over the handle so they don\u2019t catch fire, then cover pot with lid. Cook over medium-high heat until steaming, 7\u201310 minutes (check after 7 minutes; if you don\u2019t see steam, cover and continue to cook).\nPour remaining 1/4 cup oil evenly over rice, cover pot, and let steam over low heat until rice and potatoes are cooked through, 30\u201340 minutes. Taste to make sure rice is fully cooked; if not, add 1/4 cup more water, then let steam another 10 minutes.\nSpoon rice onto a platter.

Ingredients:['1/4 cup granulated sugar', '1 Tbsp. baking powder', '2 tsp. finely grated lemon zest', '1 tsp. kosher salt', '2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for surface', '1/2 cup (1 stick) chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces', '1 1/3 cups chilled heavy cream', '2 lb. fresh (or frozen) sweet cherries, pitted', '1/2 cup granulated sugar', '1/4 cup fresh lemon juice', '3 Tbsp. cornstarch', '1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon', '1 tsp. vanilla extract', '1/4 tsp. almond extract', '1/4 tsp. kosher salt', '3 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted, slightly cooled', '2 Tbsp. raw sugar', 'Vanilla ice cream or softly whipped cream (for serving)', 'A 1 1/2\"-diameter cookie cutter']. Steps:Whisk granulated sugar, baking powder, lemon zest, salt, and 2 cups flour in a medium bowl. Add butter and toss to coat. Quickly smash butter into flour mixture with your fingers, working until the largest pieces are about the size of a pea. Gradually stream cream into bowl, tossing flour mixture constantly with a fork to distribute. Using a flexible bench scraper or a hard plastic spatula, fold dough over and onto itself several times, scraping bottom and sides of the bowl, to bring together into a mass (dough will feel very wet and sticky).\nTurn out dough onto a generously floured surface. Pat into a 3/4\"-thick rectangle or square with floured hands, using bench scraper or spatula to lift up dough and dust underneath with more flour as needed to prevent sticking. Dust surface with more flour, then cut dough into 4 equal pieces and stack on top of each other. Dust with flour and press down on stack with a rolling pin to flatten to a workable height. Roll out to 1/2\" thick, dusting with more flour as needed.\nUse cutter to punch out biscuits as closely as possible, dipping cutter in flour often. Transfer biscuits to a plate. You should have about 40. Gather up dough scraps, reroll, and punch out more biscuits if needed. Chill until ready to use.\nDo Ahead: Dough can be made 1 day ahead; wrap tightly and chill.\nPlace a rack in middle of oven and preheat to 400\u00b0F. Mix cherries, granulated sugar, lemon juice, cornstarch, cinnamon, vanilla extract, almond extract, and salt in a large bowl. Scrape filling into a 2-qt. baking dish or 9\"-diameter cake pan with 2\" sides and press down on it firmly to compact. Place on a foil-lined baking sheet.\nArrange chilled biscuits over filling, fitting snugly so they\u2019re touching with only a few gaps. Brush generously with butter; sprinkle with raw sugar.\nBake cobbler 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350\u00b0F and continue to bake until biscuits are golden brown and juices are bubbling, 50\u201365 minutes more. Let cool slightly. Serve cobbler with ice cream.\nDo Ahead: Cobbler can be baked 1 day ahead; store tightly covered at room temperature.",

Steps:Prepare a grill for medium heat. Heat 1/2 cup oil in a small skillet over medium. Once oil is shimmering, stir in vadouvan and remove skillet from heat (it should foam a little). Let cool in pan.\nCombine curry oil, chile, ginger, garlic, chopped cilantro, and 2 Tbsp. lime juice in a small bowl. Season curry verde with kosher salt and set aside.\nPlace fish on a cutting board and pat dry thoroughly with paper towels (inside and out). Using a sharp knife, make slashes crosswise on a diagonal along the body every 2\" on both sides, cutting all the way down to the bones (this will help the fish cook evenly). Place fish and 4 whole scallions on a rimmed baking sheet; season fish generously inside and out with kosher salt and pepper. Drizzle fish and scallions with remaining 1/2 cup oil (this may seem like a lot, but it\u2019s the best way to prevent the fish from sticking to the grate).\nClean and oil grate, then immediately place fish and whole scallions on grill. Grill, turning scallions occasionally, until lightly charred all over, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board. Continue to grill fish, undisturbed, 8\u201310 minutes. Lift up slightly from one edge to see if skin is puffed and lightly charred and easily releases from grate. If fish is not ready, let it grill another minute or so, then try again. Once it releases easily, gently slide 2 large metal spatulas underneath and turn onto second side. Grill until the other side is lightly charred and skin is puffed, 8\u201310 minutes, depending on size of fish.\nFinely chop grilled scallions and add to reserved curry verde.\nToss sliced scallions, cilantro leaves, and remaining 1 Tbsp. lime juice with a pinch of kosher salt in a medium bowl.\nSpoon curry verde on a platter and set fish on top.

Steps:Season chicken wings with equal parts salt and pepper\u2014just enough to lightly coat the wings, then rub gently into wings.\nMix flour and cornstarch in a mixing bowl. Dredge each wing in the mix until there\u2019s NO visible moisture on each wing. Shake off excess, then set aside on a plate or rack.\nPour 2 inches of oil in a pot, or enough to submerge the wings. (If you\u2019re frying up whole wings\u2014where the drumette, the wingette, and the tip haven\u2019t been cut apart\u2014pour in 3 inches.)\nOver high heat, heat the oil to 350\u00b0F. Par(tially)-fry the wings for 10 minutes, then remove from pot, and shake off any excess oil. The par-fry cooks the chicken completely through, sealing in the flavor, while starting to form the outside crispy layer.\nSet wings on a paper towel\u2013lined plate or rack for 5 minutes, or until they cool to room temperature. This prevents the meat from overcooking, while keeping in its moisture.\nOPTIONAL: You can store the par-fried wings in the fridge and do the second wing fry the next day. Just be sure the wings are at room temperature when you fry them.\nOnce the wings cool down, reheat the oil to 350\u00b0F and fry them a second time for 10 more minutes. The second fry crisps the wings to the point of delicious crunchiness. Remove wings, then shake off excess oil. Brush on or toss wings in a bowl with your favorite sauce.

Ingredients:['Vegetable oil (for pan)', '1 1/2 cups very strong coffee, cooled', '1 Tbsp. dark rum', 'Pinch of kosher salt', '1 Tbsp. plus 1/3 cup sugar', '1 cup chilled heavy cream', '1/2 cup mascarpone', '3 large egg yolks', '24 ladyfingers', 'Cocoa powder (for dusting)']. Steps:Lightly oil a 9x5\" loaf pan and line with plastic wrap, leaving plenty of overhang. Whisk coffee, rum, salt, and 1 Tbsp. sugar in a shallow dish until sugar and salt dissolve. Chill until ready to use.\nWhisk cream and mascarpone in a medium bowl just until smooth. Set aside.\nPour water into a large saucepan to come 2\" up the sides and bring to a simmer. Combine egg yolks, remaining 1/3 cup sugar, and 2 Tbsp. water in a medium heatproof bowl. Set bowl over pan and reduce heat to low so water is at a bare simmer. Using an electric mixer (or a large whisk and a friend to fill in when your arm cramps), beat mixture on medium-high until eggs triple in volume and are extremely pale yellow and mixture forms a slowly dissolving ribbon when drizzled over itself in bowl, 5\u20137 minutes. Remove bowl from heat.\nUsing clean beaters (or whisk), beat reserved cream mixture until medium peaks form. Add egg yolk mixture and gently fold until no streaks remain.\nWorking one at a time, dip ladyfingers into chilled coffee mixture and let soak just long enough for them to soften, 1\u20132 seconds per side. Lay 8 cookies in prepared pan (it\u2019s okay to smush them in a bit). Spread one-third of filling over. Layer another 8 soaked ladyfingers on top and spread half of remaining filling over. Repeat layers one more time with remaining ladyfingers and filling. Cover pan with plastic wrap; chill tiramis\u00f9 until firm, at least 6 hours and up to 12 hours (longer is better; you\u2019ll get cleaner slices and the layers will be fully set).\nInvert a small platter or a large plate over top of loaf pan, hold together tightly, and flip them over so plate is underneath. Set on a work surface and carefully remove pan. Peel away plastic wrap from tiramis\u00f9; discard. Generously dust tiramis\u00f9 with cocoa powder. Serve in slices, dusting with more cocoa powder if desired.\nDo Ahead: Tiramis\u00f9 (without cocoa powder) can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled.",

Ingredients:['5 large poblano chiles, stemmed, seeded, and veins removed (or not, depending on how spicy you want this to be)', '2 large Yukon gold potatoes or another waxy potato, cut into 1/2-inch / 12mm cubes', '1 Tbsp sea salt, plus more as needed', '1 Tbsp safflower oil', '1 large white onion, thinly sliced', '1 cup / 240g Homemade Mexican Crema or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche']. Steps:On an ungreased comal or in a cast-iron skillet over high heat, roast the chiles, turning them over every couple of minutes using tongs or your hands (carefully, so you don\u2019t get burned). You\u2019re looking for uniform blistering, but you don\u2019t want them to become too soggy in the process, especially if you intend to stuff them, since they need to hold their shape. The process will probably take 10 to 15 minutes. Once they are well blistered and before the flesh is completely charred through in any spots, place the peppers in a plastic container with a tight-fitting lid or in a bowl that you can cover with a plate (not a towel or anything porous) and set aside to \u201csweat\u201d for about 10 minutes, or until they are cool enough to handle.\nRemove the charred skin from the whole chiles. Once you have removed and discarded the skin and seeds, cut them into rajas, or strips, about the width of fettuccine.\nIn a small saucepan, cover the potatoes with 2 inches / 5cm water and add the salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then decrease to low and simmer for about 5 minutes. Remove one of the potatoes and taste it. The piece should be soft but not falling apart, still holding its cube shape. Cubed like this, they will cook quite quickly, so be attentive. Once they have the right texture, drain the potatoes and set aside in a medium bowl with a lid or cover the pan with a plate to keep them warm.\nUsing the same comal or skillet in which you toasted your chiles, heat the oil over medium-high heat until it\u2019s hot but not smoking. Add the onion and saut\u00e9 until it\u2019s translucent but not browned.\nIn a saucepan, combine the potatoes, chiles, onion, and crema or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. Bring to a boil, then turn off the heat and let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes. As the mixture cools, the starches will absorb some of the melted cream and help it firm up. Taste and add more salt if needed. Serve as you wish!\nDo Ahead: These potatoes can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.",

Ingredients:['2 (8-oz.) skinless, boneless chicken breasts', '3 large eggs, beaten to blend', '2 cups panko', '3/4 cup all-purpose flour', 'Kosher salt', '8 sage leaves', '4 thin slices prosciutto', '2 cups vegetable oil', '4 scallions, very thinly sliced on a diagonal', '8 oz. sugar snap peas, strings removed, thinly sliced', '1/2 cup mint leaves, torn if large', '2 tsp. finely grated lemon zest', '1 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice', '1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil', 'Flaky sea salt', 'Lemon wedges (for serving)']. Steps:Place a chicken breast on a cutting board. Holding a knife parallel to board and working along a long side, cut through center of breast until you are 1/2\" from the other side. Open like a book and place butterflied breast between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. Gently pound as thin as possible without tearing meat\u2014about 1/4\" thick and 8\" wide is ideal. Repeat with remaining breast.\nPlace eggs, panko, and flour in separate shallow bowls (cake pans or pie plates work great). Season cutlets lightly with kosher salt. Working with 1 cutlet at a time, press 2 sage leaves onto both sides of meat. Wrap 2 pieces of prosciutto around each cutlet. Dredge in flour, shaking off excess. Dip in eggs, letting excess drip back into bowl. Coat in panko, pressing lightly to help it adhere, then shaking off excess. Place cutlets on a rimmed baking sheet.\nHeat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high until very hot (an instant-read thermometer should register 350\u00b0F\u2013375\u00b0F). Carefully lower 1 cutlet along the side of the skillet closest to you and let it slide into oil so it\u2019s lying flat. Swirl oil in skillet carefully so that cutlet is submerged and cook just until bottom side is golden brown, about 2 minutes. Using tongs, carefully turn and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack; season with kosher salt. Let sit 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining cutlet.\nToss scallions, peas, mint, lemon zest and juice, and olive oil in a medium bowl; season with kosher salt. Arrange cutlets on a platter and top with pea salad. Sprinkle with sea salt; serve with lemons.",

Aleppo-style pepper', '3 large shallots, thinly sliced', '2 1/2 lb. new potatoes, halved, quartered if large', '1/2 cup coarsely chopped dill', 'A deep-fry thermometer']. Steps:Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 325\u00b0F. Pat chicken halves dry with paper towels and season generously all over with salt. Arrange, skin side up, on 2 wire racks set inside 2 baking sheets so that you have 2 chicken halves on each rack. Roast chickens, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and front to back halfway through, until just golden and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breasts registers 150\u00b0F, 45\u201350 minutes.\nMeanwhile, pulse garlic in a food processor until finely chopped. Heat 1 cup oil in a small saucepan over medium until shimmering. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until softened and slightly darker, about 1 minute. Transfer to a small bowl.

Reheat shallot oil to 350\u00b0F if needed. Working with 1 half at a time and maintaining oil temperature between batches, fry chickens, skin side down, until skin is crisp and deeply browned, 6\u20138 minutes. Transfer to clean wire racks as you go; season lightly with salt.\nMeanwhile, combine potatoes and 2 Tbsp. salt in another large pot and pour in cold water to cover by 1\".

Drain and return potatoes to the same pot. Gently press down on potatoes to break up slightly. Add 1/3 cup reserved garlic oil, season with salt, and toss to combine.\nTransfer potatoes to a small platter. Drizzle with some more garlic oil.

Ingredients:['1 cup whole milk', '1 Tbsp. active dry yeast', '1 large egg', '1 large egg yolk', '3 1/2 cups (475 g) all-purpose flour', '1/2 cup (105 g) granulated sugar', '1 1/2 tsp. (3 g) ground cardamom', '1 tsp. kosher salt', '6 Tbsp. room temperature unsalted butter, plus more for bowl', '6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature', '3 Tbsp. ground cinnamon', '1 1/2 cups (packed) brown sugar, divided', 'All-purpose flour (for surface)']. Steps:Heat milk in a small saucepan over low until just warm; an instant-read thermometer should register 105\u00b0F\u2013115\u00b0F. Pour into the large bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk in yeast and let sit until foamy, 10\u201315 minutes. You should see a layer of foam on the surface; this means that the yeast is active.\nAdd egg, egg yolk, flour, granulated sugar, cardamom, and salt to yeast mixture and mix with dough hook on low speed until well combined. Increase speed to medium and continue to mix until dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Gradually add butter 1 Tbsp. at a time, mixing to incorporate slightly before adding more. When 6 Tbsp. butter are incorporated, mix until dough is smooth, supple, and shiny, 10\u201315 minutes longer (you need to mix this long to develop the gluten).\nTransfer dough to a large buttered bowl, cover with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel, and let sit at room temperature until doubled in size, 1\u20131 1/2 hours. Punch dough down, cover bowl tightly in plastic wrap, and chill overnight (the slow proof creates more flavor because it gives the yeast more time to process the sugar).\nMix butter, cinnamon, and 1/2 cup brown sugar in a medium bowl until combined.\nHave your tools and filling nearby; you want to work quickly and keep dough as chilled as possible to make rolling more manageable. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured piece of parchment paper and roll to a 1/4\"-thick rectangle, about 16\"x12\". Cover with plastic and chill until dough is firm, 30\u201360 minutes.\nSpread butter mixture over two-thirds of dough. Fold plain side over the middle, then fold opposite third over (like folding an envelope). Roll to a 12\"x8\" rectangle about 1/2\" thick. Slice lengthwise into eight 1\"-thick strips.\nWorking one at a time, lay strip on clean work surface with long side facing you. Using your palms, gently twist each end in opposite directions until entire strip is spiraled. Hold one end of strip between a thumb and index finger. Working away from you, tightly wrap strip around 3 fingers. Wrap around fingers again, placing second loop closer to the palm of your hand. As you bring strip across the back of your hand, cross over first loop, angling toward the end of your index finger. Cross dough over front of your hand and tuck the end into the center while removing your fingers and pushing through to the other side to create a knot. Check out step-by-step photos here. You want to twist these tightly so that they rise while baking. If you\u2019re having trouble, twist them into any kind of knot that you can\u2014just make sure it's wrapped tightly.\nDivide cinnamon twists between 2 rimmed baking sheets, spacing evenly apart. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature until doubled in size, 45\u201360 minutes.\nPlace racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 325\u00b0F. Bake cinnamon buns, rotating pans from top to bottom halfway through, until deeply golden brown, 25\u201330 minutes.\nBring remaining 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan. Generously brush syrup over hot buns. If you like a sweeter pastry, wait 5 minutes, then brush again.\nDo Ahead: Buns can be made 2 days ahead. Tightly wrap with plastic and store at room temperature.",

Ingredients:['3/4 tablespoon dry yeast', '1/4 cup whole milk (warmed in microwave for 30 seconds)', '4 cups all-purpose flour, sifted', '1/4 teaspoon salt', '4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted (European style recommended)', '1/4 tablespoon anise', 'Juice and zest of 1 orange', '1/2 cup water', '2 eggs, at room temperature', '1/4 teaspoon mastic (a Greek spice, available in specialty food stores or the international aisle of supermarkets; you can make this bread without mastic)', '1/4 cup sugar', '1 egg lightly beaten with 1/4 cup water (for egg wash)', '1/4 cup sesame seeds']. Steps:Dissolve the yeast in the warmed milk. Cover and set aside in a warm place to rise for 15 minutes.\nIn the bowl of an electric mixer, using the paddle attachment, mix together the flour, salt, and melted butter. Add the anise, orange juice, zest, and water. Mix together.\nAdd the eggs one at a time, and mix. Then add the mastic, sugar, and the risen yeast mixture. Mix together.\nUsing the dough hook attachment of your electric mixer (or your hands), knead the mixture for approximately 10 minutes. Cover the bowl and allow to rise in a warm place (e.g., an oven heated to 200\u00b0F) until the dough doubles in size, approximately 2 hours.\nRemove the dough from the bowl and beat it down to deflate it. Then, separate the dough into three pieces and roll out each piece lengthwise about one foot long. Braid the three pieces together.\nPlace the dough in a greased large loaf pan (5x10-inch pan recommended\u2014or you can use a greased cookie sheet). Place back in warm oven and allow the dough to double in size again, approximately an hour.\nBrush with egg wash using a pastry brush and sprinkle sesame seeds on top.\nPreheat the oven to 350\u00b0F, then bake the bread for approximately 30 minutes, or until the top turns a golden brown.",

Steps:Soak the rice in one bowl and the cashews and almonds in another in cold water for at least 30 minutes but ideally overnight.\nIn the morning, drain the rice and put it into a saucepan with the milk and 2 cups (500 ml) of cold water and bring to a simmer. Cook for 20 minutes at a gentle bubble until the rice has puffed up and the liquid is beginning to thicken.\nMeanwhile, drain the nuts and finely chop them\u2014you can do this in a food processor if you like. Bash the cardamom pods in a mortar with a pestle, spice grinder, or mixing bowl with rolling pin and remove the fragrant seeds, then discard the pods and grind the seeds until you have a powder.\nAfter 20 minutes add the nuts, raisins, spices, and honey to the rice and cook for another 15 minutes until thick and creamy, somewhere between rice pudding and porridge. You want to reach the sweet spot where the rice is soft, with very little bite, and the kheer is creamy but not too thick. If it looks like it is thickening too fast, turn the heat down and add a little boiling water from the kettle. Serve spooned into bowls with the lime zest and coconut flakes on top; if you have a sweet tooth, you could add a little extra honey on top.",

Steps:First, put your mushrooms into a bowl with the tamari, lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of the honey, and put to one side to marinate for at least 15 minutes.\nCook the soba noodles according to packet instructions. Drain and run under cold water, then toss in 1 tablespoon of the sesame oil.\nHeat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in a large soup pan over medium to high heat. Once the mushrooms have had their marinating time, drain them but keep the marinade Add the mushrooms to the pan in a single layer with a pinch of salt (you can do this in batches if you need to). Cook until the mushrooms are golden where they meet the pan, then toss and keep cooking until the mushrooms are deeply browned all over\u2014this should take 5 minutes or so. Remove from the pan and set aside.\nFill and boil the kettle. Put the empty pan back over medium heat, add the scallions and saut\u00e9 for a few minutes before adding the ginger and gochujang paste. After another minute or so, add the garlic and the drained kimchi. Sizzle until the garlic is starting to brown around the edges. Add 5 cups (1 1/4 liters) of water from the kettle along with the remaining tablespoon of honey and bring to a boil. Now, add the broccoli and simmer for 1 minute, or just until the broccoli becomes bright green.\nRemove the soup from the heat. Place the miso in a small bowl and whisk it with a splash of the broth to thin it out. Stir the thinned miso into the soup. Taste your soup; you really need to get the balance right here. If the broth tastes a bit flat, you might need more salt or miso, or a splash of soy sauce.\nJust before serving, cut the tofu into little 3/4-inch (2-cm) pieces\u2014you'll have about 1 cup\u2014and drizzle it with the reserved marinade from the mushrooms.\nTo serve, divide the noodles among four bowls and ladle over the soup. Top with to tofu, mushrooms, and a sprinkle of sesame seeds. Finish with more soy if you like, a squeeze of lemon or lime, and the shiso or cilantro leaves if using.",

Steps:In a large (10-inch or more) saut\u00e9 pan or wok, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium-high heat. Saut\u00e9 the mushrooms without disturbing until browned on the underside, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add a pinch of salt, stir, and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes, until the mushrooms are glossy and pliant. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, the chile, ginger, and the white portion of the scallions. Stir constantly until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add the pork and stir vigorously for 1 minute to heat it through.\nAdd the rice, toss well to combine, and let it sit undisturbed for 30 seconds to toast well. Add the corn and cook, tossing and stirring continuously, until warmed through, about another 30 seconds. Stir in the soy sauce and toss thoroughly to combine.\nWhile folding the rice mixture quickly, fold in the egg (don\u2019t let it sit still or the egg will pool and form ugly clumps). Remove the pan from the heat, add the scallion greens, and toss. Taste and adjust the seasoning with more salt or soy sauce as desired and serve.",

Ingredients:['1 tablespoon olive oil', '2 garlic cloves, sliced', '1 cup grape or cherry tomatoes, cut in half', 'Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste', '8 eggs', '2 tablespoons grated Parmigiano- Reggiano', '2 tablespoons slivered basil leaves', '1/2 pound cooked meatballs, cut in half if more than 1 inch in diameter', '4 ounces mozzarella, preferably fresh, cut into 1/2-inch chunks', 'Green salad', 'to serve']. Steps:Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F.\nIn a large ovenproof and preferably nonstick skillet, heat 1/2 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds, then add the tomatoes and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring once or twice, until the tomato juices are viscous and glossy, about 2 minutes. Pour the tomatoes onto a plate, and use a silicone spatula to scrape any sticky tomato juices onto the plate as well.\nWhisk the eggs until well blended, then mix in the Parmigiano and basil. Season with salt and pepper. (Start with 3/4 teaspoon salt: you can cook up a spoonful of the mix to check the seasoning.)\nHeat the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil in the skillet over medium-high heat. Place the meatballs in the pan, cut sides down if they have been halved. Evenly sprinkle in the tomatoes. Pour in the egg mixture, using a fork to evenly redistribute tomatoes or basil if necessary. Sprinkle the mozzarella evenly across the pan. Cook until the edges of the frittata start to set, then use a silicone spatula to pull the cooked egg away from the sides of the pan a bit, letting the raw egg flow behind it. Repeat a few times and cook until the eggs are almost set in the perimeter of the pan, about 5 minutes.\nPlace the pan in the oven and bake until the eggs are just set in the center and the frittata and the top is dappled with toasty brown patches, about 5 minutes. Turn on the broiler and broil for 1 minute to help set the top and to foster bubbly, toasted cheese bites.\nRemove the pan from the oven. The frittata is easiest to remove from the pan after resting 5 minutes. Slide the spatula underneath to loosen, then top with a large plate or pizza pan over the pan and invert the frittata onto it. Flip the frittata one more time onto a serving plate or cutting board so it is right side up. Serve with a green salad.",

        "content": "We will be making Irish Weekend Fry-Up, here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['Vegetable, sunflower, or olive oil, for frying', 'Butter, for frying and spreading on toast', '1-2 medium-size pork sausages', '1-2 slices (rashers) thick-cut, dry-cured, smoked or unsmoked, Canadian (back) or regular (streaky) bacon, rind removed', '2 to 3 slices of black and/or white pudding', '2 ounces (50g) button mushrooms, sliced, or 1 large flat mushroom, stem removed', 'Salt and freshly ground black pepper', '1 ripe tomato, halved', 'Pinch of sugar (if roasting the tomato in the oven)', '1 to 2 eggs', '1/2 tablespoon milk (for scrambled eggs)', '1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons (5-20g) butter (for scrambled eggs)', '2 slices white or whole-grain (brown) bread']. Steps:Heat 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the sausages and fry for 10 to 15 minutes, until golden and cooked through. Add the bacon and fry for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, until crisp and golden, dabbing off any milky liquid with paper towels. Add the black and/or white pudding slices to the pan and fry for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, until beginning to crisp; the white pudding (if using) should turn golden. Remove the sausages, bacon, and pudding slices from the pan and drain on paper towels.\nPlace in an ovenproof dish in a low oven to keep warm.\nMeanwhile, add a dash of oil and pat (knob) of butter to another frying pan over medium heat. Add the button mushrooms and saut\u00e9 for 3 to 4 minutes, until softened and turning golden. Season with salt and pepper, then remove from the pan and keep warm (adding to the dish with the sausages and bacon). If you are cooking a large flat mushroom, then add the oil and butter to the pan and fry the mushroom for 8 to 10 minutes, turning halfway through, until softened and browned.\nSeason the cut side of the tomato halves with salt and pepper and drizzle over 1 tablespoon of oil. Gently fry them, cut side down first, for 2 to 3 minutes, then turn over and fry for another 2 to 3 minutes, until just softened.\nAlternatively, cook the large flat mushroom and/or the tomatoes in the oven. Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C/Gas mark 6). Drizzle 2 teaspoons of olive oil over or add a pat (knob) of butter to the mushroom and season with salt and pepper before roasting for 12 to 15 minutes, until softened. If you are using the oven, begin roasting the mushroom and tomatoes a few minutes before frying the sausages and bacon. Once cooked, decrease the oven temperature to low for keeping everything warm as it is cooked.\nTo fry an egg, melt a pat (knob) of butter in a small, clean frying pan over low heat. Carefully crack the egg into the pan and allow to fry gently. For an over-easy egg, fry for 1 to 2 minutes, until it begins to set, then flip over and fry for another 1 to 2 minutes. If you prefer your egg sunny side up, then fry gently for 4 to 5 minutes, until the yolk has filmed over. Remove from the pan and serve immediately with the other cooked ingredients.\nFor scrambled eggs, crack the eggs into a bowl, add the milk, season with salt and pepper, and beat together. Add 1 tablespoon of the butter to a small saucepan over low heat. Immediately pour in the eggs and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring continuously (I find a wooden spatula best for this), until the butter has melted and the eggs are softly scrambled. Remove from the heat immediately so that the eggs don't become overcooked. Serve with the other cooked ingredients.\nWhile the egg is cooking, put the slices of bread in a toaster or toast under a preheated broiler (grill) for a few minutes (and on both sides, if using the broiler/grill) until golden. Butter the toast and cut the slices in half.\nTo serve, arrange everything on a warm serving plate, with the hot buttered toast on the side and with some tomato ketchup or relish.",

        "content": "We will be making Salted Plum Lychee Panna Cotta, here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['1 cup water', '2 teaspoons salted plum powder', '6 1/3 teaspoons lime juice', '2/3 teaspoon agar-agar', '1 1/3 teaspoons gelatin powder, or 2 bronze gelatin sheets/leaves (see note)', '1/3 cup plus 1 cup heavy whipping cream', '1 (20-ounce) can lychees or 20 ounces fresh lychees, peeled', '3 2/3 tablespoons milk', '1/4 cup sugar', 'Edible flowers, for garnish (optional)', 'Pomegranate seeds', 'for garnish (optional)']. Steps:Because agar-agar is seaweed-based and fairly delicate to work with, this recipe might be one you can\u2019t multitask until you get a good feel for it. Handle with care, and let\u2019s hope you don\u2019t have to frustratingly do it over and over again.\nHeat water and salted plum powder in pot over medium heat. When it starts to steam (not boil!), add lime juice and agar-agar. Whisk until agar-agar dissolves. Continue to whisk for 1 minute, or until the mixture thickens. Remove from heat and pour in a container, then let cool to room temperature. Refrigerate to settle. Once it settles, add to a blender and puree until it forms a thicker saucy consistency. Store in fridge until you\u2019re ready to bust that bad boy out!\nIf using gelatin sheets, add to a bowl of ice-cold water and submerge. Soak (aka let the gelatin bloom) for 5\u20137 minutes, or until the sheets soften. To prevent sheets from breaking down, drain water immediately after the 5\u20137 minutes and gently wring out remaining water from the sheets, just like you were wringing out a towel.\nIf using powdered gelatin, place gelatin in a bowl and add 1/3 cup heavy cream. Let it sit. Let it bloom.\nIf using a fun mold to shape and pop out your panna cotta, brush a light layer of cooking oil on the bottom and sides.\nNext, drain syrup from can of lychee (or save for a lychee-flavored cocktail or anything else that could use an \u201cinfused\u201d sugary syrup, yuuuuummers!). Add lychees to a blender and puree until smooth. Set aside.\nThis next step is very delicate because gelatin in any form is fairly unstable, so this may take some trial and error, based on a balance of your heat and your feel for that heat. You\u2019ll know what I mean if you mess up. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re a natural-born talent!\nHeat a pot with milk, sugar, and remaining heavy cream on medium-low heat until sugar dissolves and liquid is warm enough to touch. Like the Salted Plum Sauce, the milk, sugar, and heavy cream should steam but not boil. If you have a thermometer, DO NOT go over 145\u00b0F.\nNext, add gelatin (sheets or powdered in heavy cream), then whisk until gelatin dissolves. This will take a few minutes.\nRemove from heat, then immediately add lychee puree while the cream is still warm. Mix gently with a spatula.\nLadle into ramekins, small bowls, your preferred fancy or not-so-fancy container, or into your pre-oil-brushed mold.\nRefrigerate, carefully. Gelatin is fairly docile and irritably unstable. As it cools, however, panna cotta should solidify within an hour.\nIf after 2 hours it still hasn\u2019t settled, don\u2019t fret\u2014you can still recover. Recombine the cream in a pot and warm to right below boiling. Add a tad bit more (bloomed) gelatin, then remove from heat. Repour into molds. Be careful not to add too much gelatin, which will result in a stiff, less creamy panna cotta, more of a superstiff Jell-O than panna cotta.\nGarnish with a thin layer of Salted Plum Sauce on top of your final plating\u2014do fancy dots or a paintbrush swipe if you would like\u2014and edible flowers (if you somehow got these) and pomegranate seeds (if in season and available).

Steps:In a large bowl, use your hands to gently combine ground sirloin and brisket. Divide into four equal-sized, loosely meat pucks about 2 1/2 inches thick. Place patties on a plate lined with plastic wrap or parchment; transfer to the freezer for 15 minutes (do not exceed this amount of time).\nMeanwhile, heat a griddle, large cast-iron skillet, or large heavy stainless-steel skillet over medium-high heat.

Steps:Bring 6 quarts of salted water to a boil in an 8-quart pot over high heat.\nPour the tomatoes and their liquid into the work bowl of a food processor.

If the skillet is large enough to accommodate the sauce and pasta, fish the pasta out of the boiling water with a large wire skimmer and drop it directly into the sauce in the skillet. If not, drain the pasta, return it to the pot, and pour in the sauce. Bring the sauce and pasta to a boil, stirring to coat the pasta with sauce. Check the seasoning, adding salt and red pepper if necessary. Sprinkle the parsley over the pasta and boil until the sauce is reduced enough to cling to the pasta.\nRemove the pot from the heat, sprinkle 3/4 cup of the cheese over the pasta, and toss to mix.

        "content": "We will be making Grapefruit Bars with Candied Zest, here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['1 cup all-purpose flour', '3/4 cup powdered sugar', '2 Tbsp. granulated sugar', '3/4 tsp. kosher salt', '1/2 cup (1 stick) chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces', '2 large egg yolks', '1 grapefruit', '1/2 cup granulated sugar, divided', '3 large eggs', '3 large egg yolks', '1 cup granulated sugar', '1 Tbsp. cornstarch', '1 Tbsp. finely grated grapefruit zest (from 1)', '1/4 cup fresh grapefruit juice (from 1)', '2 tsp. finely grated lemon zest (from 2)', '3/4 cup fresh lemon juice (from 5\u20136)', '1 tsp. vanilla extract or paste', '1/2 tsp. kosher salt', '1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature, cut into 8 pieces', 'Powdered sugar (for serving; optional)']. Steps:Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0F. Line an 8x8\" baking pan, preferably metal, with overlapping sheets of parchment paper, leaving at least 4\" overhang on each side. Pulse flour, powdered sugar, granulated sugar, and salt in a food processor a few times to combine. Add butter and pulse until largest pieces are pea-size. Add egg yolks and pulse just until dough comes together in small clumps. (Shortbread can also be made by hand: Whisk dry ingredients in a large bowl, then work in the butter with your fingers before mixing in the egg yolks with a sturdy spoon.)\nTransfer dough to prepared pan (you may find it easier to form the dough into a ball first, instead of working with clumps\u2014entirely up to you!) and press into an even layer. If dough is sticky, use a piece of plastic wrap between your hand and the dough. Prick dough with a fork in several spots (this helps it stay flat as it bakes). Bake shortbread until edges and top are golden brown, 24\u201328 minutes. Let cool.\nWhile the shortbread is baking, use a sharp knife to remove zest from grapefruit in 2\"\u20133\" wide strips (it\u2019s okay to leave some white pith attached). Slice strips very thinly lengthwise; save fruit for another use. Combine zest and 2 cups water in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer. Drain immediately. Combine zest with 1/4 cup granulated sugar and 1 cup water in the same saucepan and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until zest is translucent and softened, 15\u201320 minutes. Drain, discarding syrup, and toss zest in a small bowl with remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar. Set aside until ready to use.\nReduce oven temperature to 300\u00b0F. Vigorously whisk eggs, egg yolks, granulated sugar, and cornstarch in a large saucepan until smooth and sugar is mostly dissolved. Whisk in grapefruit zest and juice, lemon zest and juice, and vanilla. Set saucepan over medium heat and cook, whisking constantly and making sure to get into the corners of the pan, until curd begins to bubble slightly around the edges and thickens, about 5 minutes. Simmer very gently, still whisking, 30 seconds, then remove from heat. Whisk salt into curd, followed by butter a piece at a time, whisking to fully incorporate after each addition. Scrape curd into pan with shortbread and smooth over crust. Top with some of the candied grapefruit zest (you probably won\u2019t need all of it; snack on any left over!).\nBake grapefruit bars until surface of curd is set (the center will still wobble slightly when pan is gently shaken), 20\u201325 minutes. Transfer to the refrigerator and chill until very cold, at least 3 hours, or preferably overnight.\nJust before serving, slice grapefruit bars into 2\" squares and dust with powdered sugar if desired.\nShortbread can be baked 3 days ahead. Store tightly covered at room temperature. Grapefruit can be candied 1 week ahead. Store airtight at room temperature. Bars can be baked 3 days ahead. Cover and keep chilled.",

Steps:Mix flour, baking powder, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, and 1 tsp. salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment on low speed to combine. Add butter and beat until it is flattened into nickel- and dime-size pieces and dry ingredients look a bit like sand, about 2 minutes. Cut cream cheese into 8\u201310 pieces and add all at once to mixer. Beat until dough starts to clump together in pieces (but not so long that it forms one large mass) with pieces of butter and some cream cheese still visible, about 1 minute longer.\nTurn out dough onto a work surface and divide in half. Pat each into a disk and wrap tightly in plastic. Chill just until firm, 30\u201345 minutes.\nMeanwhile, mix together orange zest, nuts, jam, and remaining 1 tsp. salt in a medium bowl. Set filling aside.\nWorking one at a time, roll out dough between 2 lightly floured sheets of parchment paper, dusting with more flour and turning over and rotating as needed, into 1/8\"-thick ovals about 18x11\". Spread half of filling over each oval, leaving a 1/2\" border. Rotate dough so a long side is closest to you and roll up into a tight spiral, using parchment to help you lift it as you go. If dough is sticking, chill 5 minutes before proceeding. Chill rolled-up dough until firm, at least 60 minutes and up to 1 day (wrapped in plastic).\nPlace racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 375\u00b0F. Finely grind raspberries in spice mill or with mortar and pestle. Transfer to a small bowl; mix in remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar. Brush tops of dough with egg. Sprinkle with half of berry sugar and cut into wedges 2\" wide at the base and 1/2\" wide at the point. Make each cut on a diagonal, changing direction each time so that short and wide ends alternate. Divide rugelach between 2 parchment-lined baking sheets. Bake, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and front to back halfway through, until deep golden brown, 28\u201334 minutes.

Steps:Whisk 1 1/3 cups flour and 3/4 tsp. salt in a medium bowl. Whisk cocoa powder, remaining 1 cup flour, and remaining 3/4 tsp. salt in another medium bowl. These are the bases for your chocolate and vanilla doughs.\nBeat butter, granulated sugar, and powdered sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add egg and vanilla and beat until smooth. Divide mixture between the 2 bowls of dry ingredients (about 1 cup in each). Scrape vanilla mixture back into stand mixer bowl (save the mixing bowl) and beat on low speed just until combined. Return to reserved bowl. Repeat process with chocolate mixture.\nArrange 2 large sheets of parchment paper on a work surface. Dollop one-quarter of chocolate dough in the center of each sheet and pat into rough 6x2\" rectangles. Dollop one-quarter of vanilla dough on top of each chocolate slab and pat into rectangles the same size and shape so that you have 2 layers each. Repeat entire process so you have 4 alternating layers. Tightly press stacked dough into cylinders about 1 1/2\" wide and 8\" long, using the parchment to help you. Wrap logs in plastic wrap and chill until very firm, at least 2 hours.\nPlace racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0F. Working one at a time, unwrap dough and brush with egg. Carefully sprinkle surface with sanding sugar and roll logs in sugar to coat well (really press dough into sugar so it sticks). Slice into rounds a generous 1/4\" thick, rotating after every few cuts to keep slices round. Arrange cookies on parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 2\" apart. Bake, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and front to back halfway through, until edges are just set, 12\u201314 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets.\nDough can be made 3 days ahead; keep chilled.

Ingredients:['2 oz unsweetened chocolate, chopped', '3/4 cup Nutella', '1 cup chilled heavy cream', '1 whole large egg', '2 large egg yolks', '1/3 cup sugar', '1/4 cup water', '1 tsp light corn syrup', '1/2 cup sugar', '1 cup hazelnuts, toasted and any loose skins rubbed off', '1 sheet frozen puff pastry (from a 17 1/4-oz package), thawed', '2 Tbsp light corn syrup', '1 1/2 tsp water', 'About 1/3 cup confectioners\u2019 sugar', 'A candy thermometer; a long metal skewer (optional)']. Steps:Melt chocolate with Nutella and keep warm.\nBeat cream with an electric mixer until it just holds soft peaks, then chill.\nBeat egg and yolks in cleaned mixer bowl with cleaned beaters at high speed until thick and pale, about 5 minutes.\nMeanwhile, bring sugar, water, and corn syrup to a boil in a 1-qt heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally until sugar has dissolved. Continue to boil, undisturbed, until candy thermometer registers 238\u00b0F (soft-ball stage; you will need to tilt pan to get temperature), about 4 minutes.\nReduce mixer speed to medium and add hot sugar mixture to eggs in a slow steam (try to avoid beaters and side of bowl), then beat until mixture is pale, thick, tripled in volume, and completely cool, about 5 minutes.\nFold chocolate mixture into egg mixture. Fold in one third of whipped cream to lighten, then fold in remaining whipped cream gently but thoroughly. Chill at least 4 hours.\nLine a baking pan with foil (shiny side up).\nHeat sugar in a heavy 10-inch skillet over medium heat, stirring with a fork to heat sugar evenly, until it starts to melt, then stop stirring and cook, swirling skillet occasionally so sugar melts evenly, until it is dark amber. Add hazelnuts, stirring until coated. Transfer to foil and cool completely, then coarsely chop.\nPreheat oven to 400\u00b0F with rack in middle. Line a large heavy baking sheet with parchment paper.\nRoll out puff pastry onto a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin into a 17- by 10-inch rectangle (about 1/8 inch thick). Transfer to baking sheet, then cover with a sheet of parchment and top with a heavy baking sheet or sheet pan to weight down. Bake until pale golden, 15 to 20 minutes.\nMeanwhile, stir together corn syrup and water.\nRemove top baking sheet and parchment. Generously brush pastry with corn syrup mixture and cover with parchment, then invert pastry and brush other side with corn syrup mixture. Replace parchment and baking sheet and bake until deep golden and crisp, 15 to 20 minutes more. Cool completely.\nUsing a serrated knife, trim edges of pastry, then halve lengthwise and cut each half into 8 equal rectangles for a total of 16 rectangles.\nArrange 8 rectangles on a baking sheet and dust with confectioners\u2019 sugar to cover. (To mark pastry decoratively, see cooks\u2019 note, below.)\nDab a small amount of hazelnut cr\u00e8me in center of 8 plates, then put an undecorated pastry rectangle on top. Divide remaining hazelnut cr\u00e8me among pastry rectangles. Sprinkle with some of the candied hazelnuts and top with decorated pastry rectangles. Sprinkle with more candied hazelnuts.\nHazelnut cr\u00e8me can be chilled up to 2 days. Candied hazelnuts keep in an airtight container 3 weeks. Pastry can be baked 2 days ahead and kept in an airtight container at room temperature.",

Steps:Put the sultanas into a mixing bowl. Chop the candied citrus peel into small dice and add to the sultanas. Finely grate the zest from the orange and add to the bowl. Squeeze in the juice of the orange, pour in the rum or brandy and vanilla, then toss together and leave for an hour.\nMelt the butter in a small pan, then leave to cool down. Put the flour into a large mixing bowl. No need to sieve it. If using fresh yeast, warm the milk to body temperature (it should feel comfortable rather than cold or scalding when you insert your finger), then crumble in the yeast and stir to dissolve. Add the sugar and salt to the flour and mix well. Beat the egg. Stir in the egg and the warm milk and butter. (If you are using dried yeast, add the yeast straight to the flour, then stir in the other ingredients followed by the warm milk, egg and butter.)\nMix thoroughly\u2014the dough should be soft, shiny and rather sticky. In all honesty it may be very sticky. Turn out on to a generously floured board and knead for a good eight minutes. As you knead, the dough will become less and less sticky and more like a bread dough\u2014though it will be heavier because of the butter and egg. When the dough is soft, elastic and no longer sticking to the board, scoop it up and put it into a floured bowl. Set aside, covered with a clean tea towel, somewhere warm and draught-free for a good hour or until it is well risen. (It won't be quite twice the size of the original dough but well on the way.) Alternatively, mix and knead using a food mixer fitted with a dough hook until the dough comes cleanly away from the sides of the bowl.\nBreak the cardamom pods open and remove their seeds. Crush the seeds to a coarse powder using a pestle and mortar or a spice mill, then mix in a small bowl with the poppy seeds, cinnamon and almonds. Dust the work surface in the flour and tip your risen dough onto it. Knead the spice and seed mixture and the soaked fruits, leaving behind most of the liquid, into the dough.\nRoll into a long loaf about 22cmx16cm and flatten it slightly: Roll the marzipan into a cylinder nearly the length of the dough, then place it in the centre. Brush the edges with a little beaten egg and press together. Turn the dough over and place it on a lined baking sheet, cover with a towel and return it to a warm place to prove for a further hour and a half.\nHeat the oven to 350\u00b0F/180\u00b0C/Gas 4. Place the loaf in the hot oven and bake for about thirty-five to forty minutes, until pale gold. Melt the butter for the glaze and brush over the loaf. Cool on a wire rack, then dust generously with icing sugar.\nWhen the loaf is thoroughly cool, wrap loosely in waxed paper or clingfilm and keep in a cookie tin.",

Steps:Cut the butter and lard into small pieces and rub it into the flour with your fingertips until you have what looks like coarse, fresh breadcrumbs. If you do this in the food processor it will take a matter of seconds. Add the egg yolk, then mix briefly with just enough cold water to bring to a smooth dough. You will probably need only one or two tablespoons. Bring the dough together into a firm ball, then knead it gently on a floured board for a couple of minutes until it softens. Reserve half of the dough, then roll the remainder out thinly. Set the oven at 400\u00b0F/200\u00b0C/Gas 6.\nUsing cookie cutters or the top of an espresso cup, cut out eighteen discs of pastry: (There may be a tiny bit left over.) Place twelve discs of the pastry in the tartlet tins, reserving six for the second batch, smoothing them up the sides so the edges stand very slightly proud of the tin. Fill each one with a dollop of mincemeat. A level tablespoon is probably all you will get into them, unless you have especially deep tins. Be generous. Roll out the reserved pastry with any leftover trimmings and make a further eighteen discs of pastry, reserving six again. Slightly dampen each of these round the edge with cold water then lay them over each tart and press firmly to seal the edges.\nUsing the point of a small kitchen knife cut a small slit in the centre of each pie and bake for twenty minutes until golden. Let them cool for a few minutes, then slide them out of their tins with a palette knife and serve warm, dusted with powdered sugar. Repeat with the remaining pastry discs and mincemeat.",

        "content": "We will be making Roasted Ducklings in Orange Sauce, here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['2 ducklings, about 5 pounds each, giblets saved for the sauce', '1 tablespoon coarse salt', '1 bunch fresh thyme', '1 bunch fresh rosemary', '6 garlic cloves, peeled', '2 oranges, one quartered and seeded; the other sliced in 1/4-inch-thick rounds', '2 to 3 onions sliced in 1/2-inch-thick rounds', '1 bunch carrots, peeled and halved lengthwise', '1/4 cup Cointreau or other orange liqueur', '1 teaspoon salt', '2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper', '16 ounces beef or chicken stock', 'Giblets and necks from the ducklings', '2 to 3 tablespoons rendered duck fat (from the roasting ducklings)', '2 tablespoons all-purpose flour', '1/2 cup Cointreau or other orange liqueur', '1/4 cup red wine vinegar', '1/4 cup balsamic vinegar', '1/4 cup fresh orange juice', '1 cup orange marmalade', '2 tablespoons thinly sliced orange peel', '1 orange', 'sliced into thin rounds', 'for garnish']. Steps:Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F. If convection is an option, choose it.\nMake the ducks. Cut away the flap of fatty skin from the neck, and scrape any loose fat from inside the cavities. Prick the skin all over gently with a sharp fork, or cross-hatch it with a sharp knife. Be careful not to pierce the meat.\nFill an 18-quart stock pot (or as large as you have) about two-thirds full with water, and add the salt. Place the bunches of thyme and rosemary and the garlic cloves in it. Bring to a rapid boil. (You may need to use two pots if you do not have a single pot large enough to hold both ducklings at once; if so, divide the thyme and rosemary into smaller held-together bunches, and divide the garlic between the pots.) Place the ducks in the pot. If they pop up, keep them submerged using a smaller pot full of water or some other weight. Be aware of overflow. Bring the water back to a slow boil. Simmer the ducks for about 30 minutes. Remove them, and use paper towels to dry them thoroughly.\nStuff each of the ducks\u2019 cavities with half of the boiled thyme, rosemary, and garlic and the quartered orange.\nLine the bottom of a large shallow roasting pan with the onions, carrots, and the orange rounds. Place the ducks, breast-side down, on top. Massage them with the Cointreau. This will give them a mahogany finish. Let them sit for 10 minutes for the skin to absorb the liqueur. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.\nRoast until the bottoms brown, about 20 minutes. Turn them breast-side up, and lower the oven temperature to 350\u00b0F. Several times during roasting, spoon off any excess fat as it accumulates, or suck it up using a baster. Use some of the fat to baste the ducks, and set the rest aside, saving some for the sauce.\nDepending on how long you boiled the ducks and the size of the ducks, roasting time will be another hour or longer. The ducks are done when a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers at least 180\u00b0F, or until the juices run clear and the leg bones wiggle easily. You want the meat to slide off the bones. Don\u2019t be afraid of overcooking these. Ducks don\u2019t dry out easily. The skin should be crisp. If not, no worries. You will pass the pieces under the broiler before serving. (If the ducks are too crisp and the meat is not finished cooking, cover them with foil as you continue roasting.) Once the ducks are ready, remove them from the oven, and cover them with aluminum foil while you finish the sauce.\nMeanwhile, make the sauce. Combine the stock, giblets, and necks in a saucepot over medium-high heat, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low to maintain a gentle boil, until the stock is reduced by half.\nFinish the sauce when you have retrieved rendered duck fat from the roasting duck. In a medium saucepan, warm the duck fat over medium heat. Add the flour, whisking with a fork as you do so. Remove the giblets and necks from the stock reduction, and discard. Add the stock to the duck fat\u2013flour mixture, raise the heat to medium-high, and stir continuously to prevent lumps as you bring it to a slow boil. Add the Cointreau, vinegars, orange juice, marmalade, and orange peel to the pan. Bring back to a boil, melting the marmalade, then simmer uncovered on low heat until the sauce thickens and is reduced. Preheat a broiler with the rack set a notch or two down from the top position.\nWhen the ducks have rested at least 20 minutes, use a sharp knife or poultry scissors to split them and cut the breasts from the legs. Discard the orange quarters, herbs, wings, and any pockets of fat that remain. Slip the breast meat from the bones. Leave the legs intact. Put a little sauce in a broiling pan, and lay the duck pieces on top. Spoon a little sauce on top of each piece. Put them under the broiler for about 1 minute to crisp and glaze. Watch them carefully; the sugar in the sauce caramelizes quickly.\nPlace the pieces on a platter, and decorate with thin, round slices of orange. Serve with additional sauce on the side.",

        "content": "We will be making Molasses Sandwich Cookies with Coffee Cream, here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour', '1 Tbsp. finely ground coffee or espresso', '1 3/4 tsp. baking soda', '1 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon', '1/2 tsp. ground ginger', '1/2 tsp. kosher salt', '1/4 tsp. ground allspice', '3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted, cooled', '1/2 cup (packed) dark brown sugar', '1/4 cup mild-flavored (light) molasses', '3/4 cup granulated sugar, plus more for rolling', '1 large egg', '3 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces', '8 oz. blond chocolate, such as Dulcey, or milk chocolate, divided', '3/4 cup heavy cream', '2 tsp. finely ground coffee or espresso', '1/2 tsp. vanilla extract', '1/4 tsp. kosher salt']. Steps:Whisk flour, coffee, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, salt, and allspice in a medium bowl.\nWhisk butter, brown sugar, molasses, and 3/4 cup granulated sugar in a large bowl until smooth (it may stiffen and separate at first; keep whisking until it loosens up). Whisk in egg.\nAdd dry ingredients to butter mixture. Mix with a silicone spatula or wooden spoon just until combined. Cover and chill dough until firm, at least 20 minutes or up to overnight.\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 375\u00b0F. Place granulated sugar in a shallow bowl. Working with about one-quarter of dough and chilling remaining dough while you assemble and bake, scoop dough by the tablespoonful and roll into balls; you should get 10 per batch. It\u2019s important to bake only 1 sheet of cookies at a time; they\u2019re very temperature-sensitive and will spread too much otherwise. Roll balls in granulated sugar, then arrange on a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing 2\" apart.\nBake cookies until centers are cracked and edges are set, 5\u20137 minutes. Resist the urge to bake the cookies longer; the aim is to maintain their chew and they will continue to crisp as they cool. If cookies are puffed, tap pan against counter as soon as they come out of the oven to deflate. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cool 5 minutes. Remove cookies from pan and let cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough for a total of 4 batches and 40 cookies.\nDough can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled. Unfilled cookies can be made 5 days ahead. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.\nPlace butter and 6 oz. chocolate in a large bowl. Bring cream just to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Remove from heat, then stir in coffee, vanilla, and salt. Pour hot cream mixture over chocolate and butter and whisk until smooth. Chill until ganache is cooled and thickened, about 20 minutes. Beat with an electric mixer or vigorously by hand with a whisk until lightened in color and stiff.\nMelt remaining 2 oz. chocolate in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Transfer to a pastry bag and snip off end of bag (or use a resealable plastic bag and cut off 1 corner) to make a very small opening.\nPlace 1 rounded tablespoon of filling on half of cookies. Press remaining cookies on top. Pipe thin lines of melted chocolate over in desired design.\nFilled cookies can be made 2 days ahead. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.",

Steps:Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Line an 8\" square metal pan with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on all sides. Butter parchment.\nWhisk flour, almonds, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl.\nUsing an electric mixer on medium-high speed (or use a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment), beat granulated sugar and 1 1/4 cups butter in a large bowl, scraping down sides, until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Reduce mixer speed to medium, add egg, and beat until incorporated, about 1 minute more. Scrape down sides of bowl. Reduce mixer speed to low and beat in orange zest, ginger, and vanilla.\nWith the mixer running on low speed, add dry ingredients and beat just until combined with some visible flour remaining. Add cranberries, coconut, and chocolate. Beat just until incorporated. Scrape down sides of bowl, then fold dough once or twice with a spatula.\nScrape dough into prepared pan. Using dampened fingers or a damp offset spatula, press dough evenly into pan. Bake shortbread until lightly golden brown and set, 25\u201330 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cool.\nDo Ahead: Shortbread can be baked 2 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.\nHeat chocolate, oil, and salt in a small heatproof bowl in a microwave, stirring every 30 seconds, until smooth and glossy, about 1 minute total.

Roast turkey, rotating pan halfway through, until skin is mostly golden brown all over, about 30 minutes.\nMeanwhile, cook vinegar, honey, Worcestershire sauce, rosemary, garlic, orange zest, and remaining 4 Tbsp. butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until bubbling and slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to lowest setting and keep glaze warm.\nReduce oven temperature to 300\u00b0F and continue to roast turkey, brushing with glaze every 30 minutes and adding more water by 1/2-cupfuls as needed to maintain some liquid in baking sheet, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast near the neck registers 150\u00b0F (don\u2019t worry; the temperature will continue to climb while the bird rests), 65\u201385 minutes longer.

Ingredients:['4 Bartlett pears (about 2 lb.), coarsely chopped', '1/4 cup unsweetened apple cider', '3 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice', '3 Tbsp. honey', '3/4 tsp. ground cinnamon', '1/4 tsp. kosher salt', 'Butter or nonstick vegetable oil spray (for pan)', '1 cup old-fashioned oats', '1 1/2 cups unsweetened apple cider', '2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour', '3 tsp. baking powder', '1 tsp. baking soda', '1 tsp. kosher salt', '4 large eggs', '2 1/2 cups whole-milk ricotta', '1/4 cup honey', '1 Tbsp. finely grated lemon zest', 'Powdered sugar (optional', 'for serving)']. Steps:Combine pears, cider, lemon juice, honey, cinnamon, and salt in a medium saucepan. Cover and heat over medium-high. When mixture starts to boil (about 5 minutes), stir and reduce heat to medium-low. Cover again and simmer, uncovering and stirring occasionally, until pears are softened, about 15 minutes.\nUsing a potato masher, mash until pears are a chunky pur\u00e9e. Continue to cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until liquid is mostly evaporated and compote is the consistency of chunky applesauce, 25\u201330 minutes. Let cool.\nDo Ahead: Compote can be made 5 days ahead. Transfer to an airtight container and chill.\nPreheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Butter an 18x13\" rimmed sheet pan. Line with parchment, then butter parchment.\nMix oats and cider in a medium bowl.\nWhisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in another medium bowl to combine.\nWhisk eggs, ricotta, honey, and lemon zest in a large bowl to combine, making sure eggs are fully incorporated. Add one-third of dry ingredients to egg mixture and whisk to combine. Add half of cider mixture to egg mixture and whisk again. Add half of remaining dry ingredients and whisk to combine. Add remaining cider mixture and whisk to combine yet again. Using a rubber scraper, fold remaining dry ingredients into batter just until combined.\nPour batter into prepared pan and spread evenly into corners with a spatula.\nDollop tablespoonfuls of pear compote across top of batter. Stick a butter knife or skewer straight down into batter and drag through compote in a figure-eight motion to create a swirling pattern.\nBake pancake until top is golden brown and center springs back when pressed with a finger, 35\u201340 minutes.\nLet pancake cool at least 10 minutes. Dust with powdered sugar, if using, then cut into 16 pieces.\nDo Ahead: Pancakes can be made 5 days ahead. Transfer to an airtight container and chill, or freeze up to 3 months. To reheat, heat sliced pancake in a toaster oven until warmed through, about 8 minutes (10 minutes if frozen); or wrap in a damp paper towel and microwave about 30 seconds (60 seconds if frozen).",

Ingredients:['1/2 batch dough (your choice of color, Green Pea Dough as shown)', 'Flour and semolina for dusting', '1/2 batch dough (your choice of color, Cacao Dough as shown)', 'Kosher salt', 'A star-shaped plunger cutter']. Steps:Choose which color of dough you want to be the background color for your stars and roll that dough to the third-thinnest setting on a pasta machine. Lightly dust a work surface with flour and place the pasta sheet on it. Using a star-shaped plunger cutter in any size you prefer, make star cutouts all over the sheet of pasta. I recommend spacing the star cutouts as close together as possible, because the sheet will get re-rolled and the stars will expand (doesn\u2019t stars expanding blow your mind?). Cover this sheet with a kitchen towel. If you wish, save the tiny cutout stars to make pastina.\nRoll the second dough on a pasta machine until it is the same size as the sheet with the star cutouts. Uncover the cutout pasta sheet and moisten it slightly with a kitchen brush dipped in water or a damp paper towel. Taking care to cover the cutout sheet precisely, lay the newly rolled sheet over the cutout sheet. Use a rolling pin to sandwich the two sheets together, rolling both lengthwise and crosswise.\nOnce you are sure the two sheets are sufficiently pressed together, use a bench scraper to carefully turn the pasta sheet over, revealing the star pattern. You may be able to make nips, tucks, and small adjustments at this point if you notice any bunching up of the pattern. Dust with flour as necessary to prevent sticking.\nRoll the sheet through the pasta machine again, starting on the widest setting. Reduce the rollers to the second-widest setting and roll the opposite end of the sheet through first this time. Alternating the sides of the sheet you put through the pasta machine will ensure that the stars don\u2019t skew too much in one direction. Keep reducing the rollers until you\u2019ve rolled the pasta sheet through the middle thickness on the pasta machine. Your stars will look wide! Don\u2019t worry; we\u2019re about to fix that.\nLay the pasta sheet flat on your work surface and cut the whole sheet crosswise in 5-inch widths (or wider, up to the width of your pasta machine rollers). The star pattern has so far been skewed only side to side, making really wide stars, so now we\u2019ll run the 5-inch sheets crosswise through the pasta machine, to stretch the stars back toward symmetry.\nFeed the 5-inch widths of pasta through the pasta machine crosswise this time, perpendicular to the direction you had been feeding them through initially. Watch the star pattern and stop sheeting at your desired thinness, depending on how stretched or skewed you want the stars. I suggest stopping at the second-or third-thinnest setting.\nWorking with one sheet at a time, cut lengthwise strips 3/4 to 1 inch wide. Hang the noodles to rest on a pasta drying rack, dowel, or the back of a chair and repeat the process with the remaining pasta sheets.\nLet the pappardelle rest for 30 minutes hanging, then gently place them on a parchment-lined and semolina-dusted sheet pan. You can boil them at this point or wait up to 2 hours at room temperature before boiling. If you would like to cook them another day, after they are leathery to the touch and no longer sticky, store the pasta on a sheet pan covered with plastic wrap in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Increase the cooking time by 1 minute if working with refrigerated pasta.\nBoil in salted water for 2 minutes, drain, dress, and serve immediately.",

Steps:Preheat the oven to 335\u00b0F. In a small ovenproof saut\u00e9 pan, combine the pecans and honey and place in the oven. After 5 minutes, stir the pan to evenly coat the pecans with the now-melted honey. After another 5 minutes, stir again. After a final 5 minutes, remove the pan from the oven and empty the nuts out onto parchment paper, making sure to separate each nut so they don\u2019t stick together once cool.\nPreheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Slice the tops off the beets and wash the beets thoroughly. Toss the beets with enough olive oil to coat (about 1/2 cup) and a pinch each of sea salt and pepper. Place in a shallow roasting pan, add about 1/4 inch water to the pan, and cover with foil. Roast until a small knife easily pierces a beet, 45 to 60 minutes. When cool enough to handle, use your hands and a towel to slide the peels off under cold running water. Cut the beets into wedges and toss them with half of the lemon juice, a pinch of sea salt, and 1/2 cup olive oil. Set aside.\nIn a bowl, toss the arugula with a pinch of sea salt and the remaining lemon juice and olive oil and divide among four plates. Add the figs to the bowl that had the arugula and toss with whatever dressing is still in the bowl (give them a good stir to coat). Arrange the figs atop the arugula. Add the beets and pecans to the plates in the same manner and garnish with small dollops of labneh.",

Steps:Mix salt, brown sugar, and pepper with your fingertips in a medium bowl to combine.\nPlace turkey legs on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Place breasts on another wire rack set inside another rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle dry brine all over outside of turkey, patting to adhere and nudging into crevices (you won\u2019t need all of the brine, but it\u2019s good to have extra since some of it will fall onto the baking sheet).

Steps:Remove any feathers and quills with pliers (kosher turkeys tend to require this more than others).\nPut oven rack in lower third of oven and preheat oven to 450\u00b0F.\nRinse turkey inside and out and pat dry. Mix salt and pepper in a small bowl and sprinkle it evenly in turkey cavities and all over skin. Fold neck skin under body and, if desired, secure with metal skewer, then tuck wing tips under breast and tie drumsticks together with kitchen string.\nPut turkey on rack in a large flameproof roasting pan. Roast, rotating pan 180 degrees halfway through roasting, until thermometer inserted into fleshy part of each thigh (close to but not touching bone) registers 170\u00b0F, 1 3/4 to 2 1/2 hours.\nCarefully tilt turkey so juices from inside large cavity run into roasting pan. Transfer turkey to a platter (do not clean roasting pan) and let stand 30 minutes (temperature of thigh meat will rise to 180\u00b0F). Cut off and discard string from turkey.\nTwelve cups of stuffing will fill both cavities and leave you extra to bake separately. Just before roasting, spoon room-temperature stuffing loosely (stuffing expands as it cooks) into the neck (smaller) cavity. Fold the neck skin underneath the body and secure with a small metal skewer. Then loosely fill the body (larger) cavity, and tie drumsticks together. If you don't want any stuffing to spill out, cover the opening with a slice of fresh bread, tucking it inside the cavity before tying the drumsticks. Follow roasting directions above. (Timing for a stuffed bird may be slightly longer, but start checking the temperature at 1 3/4 hours.) Immediately transfer stuffing from body cavity to a shallow baking dish (separate from one for stuffing baked outside the turkey). Take temperature of stuffing in neck cavity and if less than 165\u00b0F, add it to the baking dish. Bake (covered for a moist stuffing or uncovered for a crisp top) until it reaches a minimum of 165\u00b0F. This can take 20 to 45 minutes, depending on the temperature of the oven, which you may have lowered to reheat side dishes.\nThe same method used above can be applied to a whole turkey breast (instead of the entire bird). For a 6- to 8-pound breast (with skin and bone), reduce amount of salt to 1 1/2 teaspoons and pepper to 3/4 teaspoon. Use a V-rack instead of a flat rack. Roast, rotating pan 180 degrees halfway through roasting, until thermometer inserted in thickest part of each breast half (close to but not touching bone) registers 170\u00b0F, about 1 hour 10 minutes to 1 1/2 hours. Let stand 30 minutes (temperature in breast will rise to between 175\u00b0F and 180\u00b0F). (For a grilled turkey option, see Grilled Whole Turkey.)",

Ingredients:['2 pounds chuck eye steak or skirt steak, no more than 3/4 inch thick', '2 tablespoons grapeseed oil or other mild-tasting oil', 'Coarse sea salt and coarsely ground black pepper', '2 cups carrot tops', '1 cup fresh basil leaves', '1 cup fresh mint leaves', '5 anchovies (half 2-ounce can)', 'Oil from the can of anchovies or other strong-tasting oil such as extra- virgin olive oil. Refill the half-emptied anchovy can with olive oil to get another batch of anchovy oil for next time.', '2/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil', '1 teaspoon honey', 'Finely grated zest and juice of 1/2 lemon']. Steps:Start by setting up your grill for high heat. Oil up the top side of your steaks and season with lots of salt and pepper.\nSlap your steaks, oil-side down, onto the grill. Season with more S&P; and a little more oil and let them really char, about 3 minutes per side for medium rare, a minute less or a few minutes more for rarer or more well- done. Take your steaks off the grill and let them rest.\nWhile the steaks are resting, blitz your carrot tops, basil, mint, anchovies, anchovy oil, olive oil, honey, lemon juice, and lemon zest in a food processor. Once smooth, season with S&P; and pour into a bowl.\nIf you want, while the grill is still hot, oil the cut surface of the lemon half and char it. Slice the steaks against the grain, squeeze any juice remaining in the lemon over the steaks, and plate with a generous amount of the carrot top salsa verde.",

Steps:Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Working one at a time, cook lobsters 3 minutes, then transfer to a large bowl of ice water. Let cool just until you can comfortably handle them, about 1 minute, then twist off claws where the knuckles meet the body and return them to pot of boiling water. Cook 2 minutes (leave bodies in ice water). Add claws back to ice water and let both claws and bodies cool completely. (The lobsters are intentionally undercooked at this point but will finish cooking in the sauce.)\nRemove bodies and claws from ice water. Twist tails off bodies with your hands; discard heads (you won\u2019t get enough meat to make it worth your time). Working with 1 tail at a time, place on a cutting board and, using a chef\u2019s knife or cleaver, cut lengthwise all the way through tail in one motion. You should now have 2 even halves. Remove any tomalley or eggs from tails and discard. Remove meat from shells; discard shells. Using the back of a cleaver or a lobster cracker, crack claws on all sides and pick out meat; discard shells. Cut tail and claw meat into bite-size pieces. Place in an airtight container; cover and chill until ready to use.\nHeat oil and ghee in a large skillet over medium. As soon as ghee is melted, add onion and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until garlic is very soft, about 5 minutes. Add basil and as soon as it is wilted, add the tomatoes, crushing well with your hands as you go. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook sauce until thick and flavors have melded, 20\u201325 minutes. Season sauce with salt and pluck out basil.\nMeanwhile, cook pasta in another large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until very al dente (about 1 minute less than package directions).\nUsing tongs, transfer pasta to skillet with sauce, then add nduja and a splash of pasta cooking liquid and reduce heat to medium-low (high heat can cause the sauce to break). Cook, tossing gently and adding splashes of pasta cooking liquid as needed to get sauce to cling tightly to pasta, until sauce and nduja are combined, about 1 minute. Taste and season pasta with salt if needed.\nAdd chilled lobster meat to pasta and cook, tossing gently, just until lobster meat is warmed all the way through, about 2 minutes.\nDivide pasta among bowls and top with tarragon and parsley leaves.\nLobster can be cooked 1 day ahead; keep chilled. Tomato sauce can be made 3 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill. Reheat over medium before using.",

Bring cream and milk to a bare simmer in a large saucepan and remove from heat.\nVigorously whisk egg yolks and sugar in another medium bowl until pale yellow and sugar is dissolved (rub between fingers to check), about 2 minutes.\nGradually pour cream mixture into egg yolk mixture, whisking vigorously. Immediately pour egg yolk mixture into saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a heatproof rubber spatula and making sure to get into the corners of the pan, until an instant-read thermometer registers 175\u00b0F (custard should be thick enough to coat a spoon; do not let it simmer or allow thermometer to go above 180\u00b0F).\nPour custard over reserved chocolate and let sit until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Using an immersion blender or a whisk, blend until emulsified (if using a whisk, you may want to strain budino through a fine-mesh sieve after to ensure a silky texture). Add kosher salt and 1 Tbsp. oil to chocolate mixture and blend to incorporate.\nDivide budino evenly among six 8\u201312-oz. glasses. Cover with plastic wrap and chill until firm, at least 1 hour.\nTop each budino with candied walnuts, sprinkle with sea salt and pepper, and drizzle with a little oil. Serve with scoops of gelato if desired.\nWalnuts can be candied 1 week ahead. Store airtight at room temperature. Budinos (without toppings) can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled.",

        "content": "We will be making Cardamom Knots, here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['50g (3 1/2 Tbsp) butter, cubed', '250ml (1 cup) whole milk', '500g (1 lb) white bread flour, plus extra for dusting', '1 (7g) packet fast-acting dried yeast', '1 tsp fine salt', '50g (1/4 cup) granulated sugar', '1 tsp ground cardamom', 'Oil, for greasing', '150g (10 1/2 Tbsp) butter, softened', '100g (1/2 cup packed) soft dark brown sugar', '2 tsp ground cardamom', '50g (1/4 cup) granulated sugar', '1/2 tsp ground cardamom', 'Pearl sugar', 'to decorate (optional)']. Steps:Start by making the dough. Place the cubed butter in a small saucepan with the milk. Heat over a low heat until the cubes of butter have completely melted, then remove from the heat and set to one side to allow the mixture to cool for a few minutes.\nPlace the flour in a large bowl, or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough-hook attachment, and add the yeast to one side of the bowl and the salt, sugar and cardamom to the other. If you put the salt directly on the yeast it may kill it, which will stop your dough from rising.\nGradually pour the warm butter and milk into the bowl with the flour,mixing all the time, using your hands or the dough-hook attachment, until a sticky dough forms. You may not need to add all the milk mixture, or you might need to add a little more milk \u2013 you want to add just enough to make a sticky but not wet dough.\nDust your worktop lightly with flour, tip the dough out on to it and knead it for 5\u201310 minutes (or knead using the dough hook on the stand mixer) until the dough is no longer sticky and has become smooth and elastic. Grease the bowl in which you mixed the dough with oil, place the dough back in the bowl, cover with a tea towel or cling film and leave to rise at room temperature for 1\u20133 hours or until doubled in size. You can leave the dough to prove in the fridge overnight if you want these for breakfast!\nWhile the dough is rising, combine the filling ingredients in a small bowl to make a thick paste. Line 2 baking trays with baking parchment.\nTip the risen dough out of the bowl on to a worktop lightly dusted with flour and fold it in on itself a couple of times to knock out any large air pockets.\nRoll out the dough thinly to make a very large rectangle measuring roughly 50 x 30cm. Spread the cardamom filling mixture all over the dough, making sure it goes right to the edges.\nFold one of the short ends over two-thirds of the dough, then fold the remaining third over \u2013 as if you are folding a letter or making puff pastry. You should have one neat rectangle consisting of three layers of dough, and all the filling should be enclosed inside.\nUse a sharp knife to cut the dough into 12 even strips. Taking one of the strips, stretch out and twist it a few times. Tie it into a loose knot, tucking the edges in. Place the knot on a lined baking tray and repeat with the remaining strips, arranging them on the tray and leaving a few centimeters between each. Leave for 45 minutes at room temperature to rise again.\nWhile the knots are proving, preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F/200\u00b0C/180\u00b0C fan/gas 6. Make the cardamom syrup by bringing the sugar, ground cardamom and 50ml of water to the boil in a small saucepan and letting it bubble for a few minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat.\nBake the buns for 15\u201320 minutes or until golden brown, then brush with the cardamom syrup as soon as they come out of the oven. Sprinkle with pearl sugar, if you wish, and serve warm.",

Ingredients:['1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting', '1/2 teaspoon kosher salt', '1 1/2 tablespoons granulated sugar', '8 tablespoons (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, cubed', '1 tablespoon bourbon (see Tip below)', '1/2 cup ice water', '5 medium apples, peeled and thinly sliced', 'Juice of 1/2 lemon', '3/4 cup packed brown sugar', '1/4 cup granulated sugar', '2 tablespoons cornstarch', '1 tablespoon ground cinnamon', 'Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg', '6 slices bacon', '1 egg', 'beaten']. Steps:In a stand mixer fitted with the flat beater attachment, combine the flour, salt, and sugar with your fingertips. Add the cold butter and mix on low until the dough looks like coarse sand. Turn the machine off and blend any large pieces of butter with your fingertips, making sure there are no pieces of butter larger than the size of a pea.\nIn a measuring cup, combine the bourbon and ice water. With the stand mixer on low, slowly dribble in the bourbon water 1 tablespoon at a time. Add just enough liquid for the dough to pull away from the sides of the bowl. (You may not need to use all the bourbon water.) Pinch the dough between your fingertips; it should be smooth, not sticky or crumbly. Gently press the dough together and shape into a disk. Wrap the disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 3 days.\nIn a bowl, combine the apples, lemon juice, brown sugar, granulated sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Toss with your fingertips until the apple slices are coated evenly.\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough, rotating it in quarter-turns, until 12 to 14 inches in diameter and 1/8 inch thick. Gently fit the dough into a 9-inch pie plate. Trim the edges of the dough with scissors, making sure to leave at least a 1-inch overhang.\nCrack the egg into a small dish. Without breaking the yolk, use a pastry brush to gently coat the bottom and sides of the pie shell with a thin layer of the egg white (reserve the remaining egg). The egg white creates a barrier between the filling and the crust as it bakes, keeping the crust from getting soggy. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.\nSpoon the filling into the chilled pie shell. Place 3 bacon slices on top of the filling horizontally. Then, one by one, place the remaining 3 strips vertically, lifting every other horizontal strip to create a basket weave lattice. Crimp the edges by folding the excess overhang inward at a slight angle and pressing down firmly with your thumb.\nContinue crimping the edges all the way around the pie, tucking in the ends of the bacon slices as you crimp the edges. Beat the reserved egg and gently brush onto the exposed edges of the pie dough. Refrigerate the pie for 20 minutes to allow the pastry to set.\nPreheat the oven to 425\u00b0F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil.\nPlace the pie on the lined baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 375\u00b0F and bake until the crust is golden brown and the bacon is crisp, about 30 minutes. Cover the edges of the crust with foil if it is browning too quickly. Drain off any excess liquid by tipping the pie to one side. Let cool for 1 hour before serving.",

Steps:Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0F. Toast coconut on a rimmed baking sheet until golden brown, 3\u20135 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes.\nPlace graham crackers in a large resealable plastic bag, seal, and crush to fine crumbs with a rolling pin or heavy pot. Transfer to a medium bowl. Add toasted coconut, coconut oil, and salt and mix well. Mixture will look quite crumbly and dry at this point, but it will come together as it chills.\nLightly coat a 9\" pie dish with nonstick spray. Transfer graham cracker mixture to pie dish and press evenly and very firmly across bottom and up sides of dish with a flat-bottomed measuring cup (make sure crust extends all the way up to the lip of the dish). Chill until ready to fill (at least 20 minutes).\nWhile the crust is chilling, remove coconut ice cream from containers (just peel away container if it\u2019s paper, or use a rubber spatula to help slide ice cream out intact if container is plastic). Cut ice cream into 2\" pieces and place in a medium bowl. Repeat with strawberry ice cream, placing in a separate medium bowl. Let sit until slightly softened, about 5 minutes, then stir each, separately, with a large rubber spatula or wooden spoon until the consistency of thick cake batter. Transfer bowls to freezer and chill ice cream 10 minutes.\nRemove ice cream from freezer. Scrape strawberry ice cream into bowl with coconut ice cream. Fold together a couple of times with spatula until swirled. Don\u2019t overmix; you want thick marbled ribbons. Chill in freezer 10 minutes.\nScrape marbled ice cream into crust. Using a large spoon, create deep decorative swirls in ice cream (the strawberries will be poured into these divots later). Freeze until ice cream is very firm, at least 6 hours.\nToss strawberries, lemon juice, and sugar in a medium bowl. Let sit at least 35 minutes and up to 1 hour.\nRemove pie from freezer and lower the bottom of the pie dish into a shallow bowl of warm water; hold it there 5 minutes (this will help slices release more easily). Spoon strawberries into divots; if you run out of places to contain them, reserve extras for serving.\nRunning the blade of a chef\u2019s knife under hot water and wiping dry before first cut and repeating as needed between cuts (this will give you neat sides), slice pie into wedges. Serve with any remaining strawberries alongside.\nPie (without berries) can be made 1 week ahead. Cover with plastic wrap once hardened and keep frozen.",

Whisk in the ice-cold water and the vinegar.\nPour the liquid mixture into the flour-butter mixture, and combine using a wooden spoon. Mix until the dough comes together in a shaggy mass. Be careful not to overmix. Use floured hands to divide the dough in half and then form into 2 balls. Wrap each ball tightly in plastic wrap. Let them chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour before rolling out and beginning the sonker recipe.\nButter and lightly flour a 13x9-inch baking dish (see Note).\nOn a floured surface, roll out one chilled dough ball into a large rectangle that will fit into the baking dish. Transfer the rolled-out dough to the prepared baking dish, and press it down gently to line the dish and form the bottom crust. Place the dish in the refrigerator to chill.\nPut the whole peeled sweet potatoes in a large pot, add cold water to cover, and add the salt. Place the pot over medium heat, cover, and bring to a boil. Then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are fork-tender, about 25 minutes.\nUse a large slotted spoon to transfer the cooked potatoes to a cutting board to cool. Measure out and reserve 1 1/2 cups of the cooking liquid to use later. Slice the cooled sweet potatoes into rounds, making them as thin as possible without breaking them.\nPreheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.\nRemove the dough-lined pan from the refrigerator and layer the sliced sweet potatoes on top of the crust. In a medium bowl, combine 1 cup of the sugar, the sorghum, the 1/3 cup flour, the butter, and the 1\u00bd cups reserved cooking liquid. Mix well and pour over the sweet potatoes.\nRoll out the remaining dough ball into a rectangle a little smaller than the first. Cut it into strips that are about 1/2 inch wide, and form a lattice crust on top of the sweet potatoes.\nBake for about 40 minutes, until the crust is golden brown (the sonker will not be fully baked at this point).\nWhile the sonker is baking, prepare the milk dip: Whisk 1/2 cup of the milk with the cornstarch in a medium saucepan, making sure all the cornstarch is dissolved. Add the remaining 2 1/2 cups milk and the remaining 1/2 cup sugar. Set the pan over medium-high heat and let it come to a boil. Let boil for 1 minute to thicken. Then remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla.\nWhen the sonker has cooked for 40 minutes, pour 2 cups of the prepared milk dip over the entire surface. Return the sonker to the oven and bake for 15 minutes more or until it is caramelized around the edges and brown on top. Remove the dish from the oven and let it cool for at least 20 minutes before serving; the milk will continue to be absorbed and thicken.\nServe the sonker just warm, with the remaining milk dip on the side for drizzling.",

Steps:Preheat oven to 300\u00b0F. Place salmon on a rimmed baking sheet and rub 2 Tbsp. oil over each side. Season all over with black pepper, 2 tsp. kosher salt, and 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes. Arrange skin side down and roast until a tester, metal skewer, or thin-bladed knife inserted laterally through salmon flesh meets no resistance, 20\u201325 minutes.

Whisk lemon juice, 3 Tbsp. oil, 2 tsp. kosher salt, and remaining 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes in a large bowl to combine. Set dressing aside.\nWorking in batches, place green beans in a large resealable plastic bag. Seal bag and whack beans with a rolling pin to split the skins and soften the insides without completely pulverizing the flesh. Place in bowl with reserved dressing. Toss, massaging with your hands to break beans down further and coat. Let sit at room temperature at least 1 hour.\nThinly slice radishes lengthwise. Place in a large bowl of ice water, cover, and chill until ready to serve (this will allow you to get the prep out of the way and keep the radishes crisp and firm).\nJust before serving, drain radishes and toss with marinated green beans. Add pistachios; taste salad and season with pepper if needed. Transfer to a platter and drizzle with oil and sprinkle with sea salt.\nUsing 2 spatulas, carefully transfer salmon to another platter, leaving skin behind on baking sheet. Drizzle with oil and squeeze juice from a lemon wedge or two over; sprinkle with sea salt. Serve with more lemon wedges and Lemony Yogurt Sauce and/or Grilled Serrano Salsa Verde alongside.\nSalmon can be roasted and green beans can be marinated 1 day ahead; cover and chill separately.

Steps:Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F/200\u00b0C/180\u00b0C fan/gas 6 and line a baking tray with baking parchment.\nPlace the rhubarb in a saucepan with the sugar and orange juice. Simmer over a medium heat for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the rhubarb pieces have completely broken down and the mixture is thick and sticky. Spoon into a small jar or ramekin and leave to cool.\nTo make the scones, place the flour in a large bowl and add the cubes of butter. Quickly rub the butter into the flour using your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Stir in the sugar and make a well in the centre.\nPour the honey into the centre of the well, then gradually add the milk, stirring it into the mixture using a round-ended knife. A soft, rough dough will form. Tip the dough out on to a lightly floured worktop and knead very briefly to smooth out the dough. Over-handling the dough will make your scones tough and flat, so knead as little as possible.\nGently roll the dough out to a thickness of around 3cm (1 inch). Cut into rounds using a 6cm (2 1/3-inch) pastry cutter, cutting straight down and not twisting, as twisting prevents the scones from rising properly. Very gently re-roll the remaining dough, taking care not to handle it too much, and punch out more scones\u2014you should get 9 in total. Arrange the scones on the lined baking tray and brush the tops with a little extra honey.\nBake for 12\u201315 minutes or until risen and golden brown. Serve warm from the oven, split in half, with big dollops of clotted cream and rhubarb compote.",

Ingredients:['225g (1 cup / 2 sticks) butter, softened, plus extra for greasing', '225g (1 cup plus 2 Tbsp) granulated sugar', '4 eggs', '225g (1 3/4 cups) self-rising flour', '50g (1/2 cup) ground almonds', 'Grated zest and juice of 1 unwaxed lemon', 'Yellow and green gel food colorings', 'Grated zest and juice of 1 lime', '4 tbsp fine-cut lime marmalade', '\"Confectioners sugar, to dust\", 500g (about 1 pound) block of marzipan', '20 x 20cm (8-inch square) cake tin.']. Steps:Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F180\u00b0C/160\u00b0C fan/gas 4, grease the cake tin and line it with baking parchment, allowing the parchment to overhang at the edges. Divide the tin cavity in half by pulling up the center of the parchment and folding a tall pleat to separate the halves. Make sure the pleat is as close to the center as possible.\nCream the butter and sugar together in a bowl for 4\u20135 minutes, using a stand mixer or an electric hand-held whisk, until pale and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, adding 1\u20132 tablespoons of the flour if the mixture curdles.\nIn a separate bowl, combine the flour and ground almonds. Gradually add the dry mixture to the wet mixture until a thick batter forms, then scoop half the mixture into a separate bowl.\nAdd the lemon juice, lemon zest and a little yellow food coloring to one half of the batter, and do the same to the other half with the lime juice, lime zest and green food coloring, mixing until fully combined.\nSpread the lemon mixture into one half of the tin and the lime mixture into the other half, with the parchment dividing them, and bake for 20\u201325 minutes or until risen and golden. Allow the cakes to cool for 5 minutes in the tin, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.\nUse a serrated knife to trim the edges off the cooled sponges. Carefully cut the sides that have colored in the oven, as they can look off-putting if used in the Battenberg. Measure the height of the baked sponge with a ruler and slice the cake into strips the same width as the height, forming a square cross section. Mine are usually 2x2cm (3/4x3/4 inches). This will create perfect squares that stack properly on top of one another.\nGently warm the lime marmalade in a small saucepan to loosen it and make it easier to spread, then pass it through a sieve. Stick one lemon strip of cake and one lime strip together using some of the lime marmalade, then stack the alternate color on top of the bottom layer to create the checkerboard effect with the four strips.\nLightly dust the worktop with confectioners' sugar, then roll out the marzipan into a large rectangle, trimming the edges so the rectangle is approximately 18x20cm (7x8-inches). Brush the top and sides of the assembled cake with the remaining marmalade, then place top-side down on to the marzipan along the short edge. Brush the face-up side of the cake with more marmalade before tightly rolling it up in the marzipan until it is covered. Press in the final section of marzipan or trim if it looks too long.\nTrim the ends of the cake using a serrated knife and transfer the Battenberg to a plate or cake stand. The cake will keep for up to 1 week in an airtight container.",

Steps:Lay lamb shoulder, cut side up, on a work surface. You will notice it\u2019s made up of a few muscle groups, separated by thin strips of fat and gaps where the bones have been removed.

Cover and let sit at room temperature 2\u20133 hours.\nMix yogurt, lemon juice, and garlic in a medium bowl. Season sauce with salt and pepper; cover and chill until ready to use.\nAbout half an hour before you plan to start grilling, slice tomatoes into 1/2\"-thick rounds and arrange on a large platter. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with half of lemon juice. Top with onion, season with salt and pepper, and drizzle remaining lemon juice over. Arrange reserved rosemary sprigs on top; set aside.\nPrepare a grill for medium heat. Without scraping off marinade, transfer larger pieces of lamb to grate and grill until underside is very well browned, about 5 minutes. Spoon some remaining marinade over lamb, turn, and continue to grill, turning every 5 minutes or any time you see a flare-up, until lamb is charred in spots and very well browned everywhere.\nAfter large pieces have been cooking about 15 minutes, add smaller pieces to grill and follow same instructions; they take less time to cook, and by staggering the start times, all the lamb will come off the grill within a few minutes of each other. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of each piece should register 140\u00b0F for medium, which is ideal. Start checking smaller pieces after 7\u201310 minutes. The largest piece will take closer to 30 minutes. As each piece finishes, transfer to reserved platter, setting on top of rosemary. Let rest 20\u201330 minutes.\nTransfer lamb to a cutting board and tuck rosemary sprigs off to sides of platter. Tip platter so that accumulated tomato and lamb juices pool at one end and spoon over tomatoes. Using a long sharp knife, slice lamb into very thin pieces and arrange on top of onion and tomatoes. Season with salt and drizzle with oil.\nDrizzle yogurt sauce with oil and serve alongside lamb.\nLamb can be seasoned 1 day ahead; cover and chill. Sauce can be made 8 hours ahead; keep chilled.",

Whisk Old Bay seasoning, baking powder, cayenne, 1/2 cup flour, and 1/2 cup cornstarch in a medium bowl. Whisk remaining 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup cornstarch in another medium bowl.\nSet a deep cast-iron skillet or large Dutch oven fitted with thermometer on grill; pour in oil to come 1\" up sides. Heat until thermometer registers 375\u00b0F.\nMeanwhile, thinly slice cucumbers lengthwise. Toss in a third medium bowl with vinegar and gently massage with your hands to soften them slightly. Let sit, tossing occasionally, at room temperature at least 10 minutes.\nLightly brush insides of rolls with butter and grill just until toasted, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a plate.\nGently whisk egg and beer in a small bowl to combine, then gently whisk into Old Bay mixture in 3 additions. Working in 2 batches, season fish lightly with salt. Dredge in flour mixture, knocking off any excess, then dip into batter and lift up with a fork, letting excess drain off and wiping against side of bowl to eliminate any thick drips. (Batter should completely coat the fish without looking clumpy.)\nCarefully lower fish into oil and fry, turning halfway through, until deeply browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of each piece registers 125\u00b0F\u2013130\u00b0F, 7\u20139 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a wire rack set inside a baking sheet.\nDrain most of vinegar from cucumbers and toss in dill. Build sandwiches with fried fish, cucumbers, lettuce, and tartar sauce.\nCucumbers (without dill) can be pickled 2 days ahead. Cover and chill.",

Steps:Preheat your oven to 325\u00b0F. Liberally prepare 3 9-inch round cake pans with the nonstick method of your choice.\nIn the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, add the flour, granulated sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt and mix on low speed. Slowly add the oil and buttermilk.\nIncrease the speed to medium-low and add the eggs 1 at a time, combining well after each addition and scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Slowly add the coffee, vanilla extract, vinegar, and food coloring. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl and mix the batter until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.\nEvenly pour the batter into the prepared pans and bake for 20 to 27 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a layer comes out clean. Do not overbake.\nLet the layers cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then invert onto wire racks. Let cool to room temperature. Lightly cover the cakes with foil or plastic wrap so they do not dry out.\nIn a medium saucepan over medium heat, warm the blackberries, granulated sugar, lime juice, and salt. Once the blackberries begin releasing their juices and the liquid begins to boil, after about 8 to 12 minutes, use a pastry cutter or fork to mash 1/2 of the berries. Leave the rest whole.\nStir in the cornstarch and continue to cook at a boil, allowing the juices to cook down and thicken. The compote is ready when the liquid coats and completely sticks to the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat. Let cool to room temperature.\nClean your stand mixer bowl and whisk attachment. Beat the cream cheese on high speed until it begins to thicken and become fluffy.\nTurn your mixer down to low speed and carefully add the confectioners\u2019 sugar. Once the sugar is fully incorporated, turn your mixer speed back up and continue whipping. Add the heavy cream, vanilla extract, and salt. Continue to whip until the frosting is smooth, light, and fluffy. Refrigerate the buttercream for 30 minutes to firm it up.\nOnce the layers are completely cooled, place 1 layer on a serving plate. Spread just the top with \u2153 of the frosting. Add \u2153 of the compote over the frosting. Using a butter knife or skewer, swirl the compote into the frosting. Add the second layer and spread with another \u2153 of the frosting. Add \u2153 of the compote, swirling the compote into the frosting again. Add the final layer, bottom-side up, and top with the remaining frosting. Add the rest of the compote and repeat the swirling process. Do not frost the side of the cake. Garnish with the whole blackberries. Serve at room temperature. Store in the refrigerator.",

Ingredients:['1/4 cup (56 g) unsalted butter, softened', '2 tbsp (39 g) yellow miso paste', '1 tbsp (3 g) thinly sliced green onions', '1/4 tsp black pepper', '2 large ribeye steaks, at least 1 1/2 inches (3.8 cm) thick', 'Kosher salt, as desired for seasoning', 'Black pepper, as desired for seasoning', '1 tbsp (15 ml) vegetable oil', '1 tbsp (14 g) unsalted butter', '3 cloves garlic, roughly chopped', '1/4 cup (10 g) thinly sliced white and light green parts of green onion', '1/4 cup (10 g) thinly sliced on the bias green onions, for garnish', '1/4 cup (4 g) cilantro leaves', 'for garnish']. Steps:For the miso butter, combine the softened butter and miso together in a small bowl. Add the green onions and pepper and combine. Keep at room temperature or roll into a 1 1/2-inch (3.8-cm) wide log in plastic wrap and refrigerate. Cut into slices before serving.\nThere is one key difference to this method for thick steaks. The first step is to slightly warm the steaks in the oven before cooking on the stove. Adjust the oven rack to the center position and preheat the oven to 275\u00b0F (135\u00b0C). Add your cast-iron skillet to the oven to warm up. I like to use a preheated cast-iron pan because it retains heat very well for searing. Place a wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet, and set aside.\nPat dry the steaks with paper towels, pressing out as much surface moisture as possible. Season both sides of the steak with salt and pepper. Transfer the steaks to the wire rack and place in the oven. The heat helps to dry the free moisture on the surface of the steaks for quicker browning and cook time in the pan.\nCook the steak until the internal temperature reaches 90 to 95\u00b0F (32 to 35\u00b0C) for medium-rare, or 100 to 105\u00b0F (38\u00b0C to 41\u00b0C) for medium, about 15 to 20 minutes. The time will vary depending on the thickness of the steaks. Remove the steaks from the oven.\nIn the warmed 12-inch (30-cm) cast-iron skillet, heat the vegetable oil over high heat until just beginning to smoke. Carefully add the steaks and sear until browned with a nice crust, about 2 minutes. Flip the steaks with tongs and sear until browned, 1\u00bd to 2 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of steak registers 120 to 125\u00b0F (49 to 52\u00b0C) for medium-rare or 130\u00b0F (54\u00b0C) for medium.\nReduce the heat to medium and add the butter, garlic and white and light green parts of green onion. Turn the steaks onto their sides to cook and render any remaining fat, about 1 to 2 minutes. Briefly baste the steaks with the butter, garlic and green onion mixture. Basting the steaks as they cook with oil helps distribute any aromatics like herbs in the pan and evenly browns the surface. The butter is added toward the end to add flavor, mouthfeel and encourage more browning due to the milk protein solids in the butter.\nImmediately transfer the steaks to a clean wire rack set on a sheet pan to rest for 10 minutes. Serve the steaks topped with the miso butter, green onions and cilantro.\nPreheating the steak at low temperature activates enzymes called cathepsins in the meat that help to tenderize the beef, which occurs below 122\u00b0F (50\u00b0C). The goal with searing is to achieve a quick sear to create a thick brown crust on the steak without overcooking the interior.",

Ingredients:['1 (1 1/2-to 2-pound) flank steak', 'Salt and pepper', '1 cup grated queso asadero', '1/2 cup chopped fresh oregano', '4 cloves garlic', 'minced']. Steps:Start the coals or heat a gas grill for medium-high direct cooking. Make sure the grates are clean. Cut at least ten 8-inch pieces of kitchen twine.\nWith a very sharp knife, slice the steak lengthwise into two pieces. With a meat mallet, rolling pin, or the bottom of a cast-iron skillet, pound the two thin steaks evenly to no more than 1/2-inch thick. Pat them dry with paper towels and sprinkle with salt and pepper on both sides.\nCombine the cheese, oregano, and garlic in a small bowl. Divide the mixture between the steaks and spread it out almost to the edges. Roll the steaks up so that the grain of the meat runs the length of the roll, so you\u2019ll be slicing them across the grain. Tie the steaks closed with the twine every 2 inches or so. (You can prepare the recipe to this point up to several hours in advance and refrigerate.)\nPut the stuffed steaks on the grill directly over the fire.

Ingredients:['2 stalks lemongrass', '2 pounds ground pork', '1 tablespoon fish sauce', '2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt', '2 teaspoons sugar', '1/4 teaspoon white pepper', '1/4 cup fish sauce', '2 tablespoons sugar', '2 tablespoons lime juice or white vinegar', '1 clove garlic, peeled and minced', '1 Thai chile or half of a serrano chile, stemmed and minced', '2 cups canola oil', '4 shallots, peeled and thinly sliced', '1 pound rice vermicelli', '2 carrots, peeled and julienned', '1 small cucumber, peeled and thinly sliced', 'Shredded lettuce', 'Mint leaves', 'Cilantro leaves', 'Chopped peanuts']. Steps:Cut the bottom 1/2 inch off each lemongrass stalk and trim the woody top portion of each stalk and discard. Peel the outer layers of each stalk until you reach the tender center. Thinly slice the stalks into coins, then very finely mince. Transfer to a medium bowl and add the pork, fish sauce, salt, sugar, and white pepper and mix to combine. Roll into 1 1/2-inch meatballs and set on a rimmed baking sheet. The meatballs can be made beforehand; transfer to a lidded container or tightly wrap the baking sheet with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until ready to use but no longer than 24 hours.\nIn a small jar with a lid, combine the fish sauce, sugar, lime juice, garlic, and minced chile. Put the lid on the jar and shake vigorously until the sugar has dissolved. Set aside (the dressing will keep, refrigerated, for up to a week, though it gets spicier as it sits).\nPour the oil into a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat and add the sliced shallots to the cold oil. Line a plate with paper towels and set it nearby. As the oil heats, the shallots will begin to sizzle and bubble; fry, stirring frequently for even cooking, until the shallots begin to brown, about 6 to 8 minutes. Continue cooking, stirring constantly, until they are an even golden brown and crisp (at this stage, they can go from nicely browned to acrid and overcooked very quickly, so be vigilant). Use a spider or slotted spoon to transfer the shallots to the paper-towel- lined plate. Let the oil cool, then pour through a fine- mesh sieve into a clean jar. (Do not discard the oil; it\u2019s liquid gold, great for another batch of fried shallots or to add flavor to dressings and saut\u00e9ed vegetables, and you can also use it to make a batch of aioli.) The fried shallots can be made in advance. Let cool, then store in an airtight container at room temperature. Resist snacking on them; they'll keep for about a week.\nBring a large pot of water to a boil. When the water is boiling add the vermicelli noodles and cook according to package instructions until tender. Drain, rinse with cold water, and transfer to a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with a tablespoon of the shallot oil (it\u2019s fine if it\u2019s still warm) and toss to coat.\nPreheat the broiler to high. Transfer the baking sheet of meatballs to the oven, positioning it a few inches from the heating element. Broil the meatballs until browned, about 3 minutes, then roll the meatballs to the second side and broil for 3 minutes longer. Transfer to a bowl.\nTo serve, arrange the vermicelli on a platter and surround with carrots, cucumber slices, lettuce, mint, and cilantro leaves. Serve the meatballs, dressing, fried shallots, and chopped peanuts alongside. Let the diners dig in, serving themselves some of the noodles, carrots, and cucumbers, garnished with herbs, shallots, and peanuts. Spoon dressing over each serving and top with a few meatballs.",

Steps:Put the palm sugar in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook until the sugar melts, about 8 to 10 minutes, stirring frequently so the sugar doesn\u2019t scorch. When the sugar is smooth and completely melted, remove the pan from the heat and slowly stir in the fish sauce. The mixture may seize; if it does, return it to low heat and continue stirring until smooth.\nPreheat the oven to 300\u00b0F. In a large Dutch oven over high heat, heat the canola oil. Season the pork pieces on all sides with salt and pepper. When the oil is hot, add some of the pieces of pork and sear until well browned on all sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet and repeat with the remaining pork. When all the pork has been browned, reduce the heat to medium and add the shallots. Cook, stirring, until the shallots are softened, about 2 minutes, then add the ginger, garlic, and chilies and cook 1 minute more.

Steps:Place the cans of coconut milk in the coldest spot in your refrigerator upside-down and leave them there for 24 hours. This will allow the coconut cream in the milk to solidify and separate from the liquid.\nLine a 9-by-5-by-3-in [23-by-12-by-7.5-cm] loaf pan with plastic wrap that hangs slightly over the sides of the pan.\nFlip the cans of coconut milk right-side up, open the cans, and, using a rubber spatula, carefully scrape the solid coconut cream into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Save the liquid for another purpose. Add the almond extract and confectioners' sugar, and whisk on medium speed until smooth and thick. Add the heavy cream and whisk on medium-high speed until the cream holds stiff peaks, about 2 minutes. Add the toasted coconut and fold it into the cream with a rubber spatula.\nUsing a small offset spatula or the back of a spoon, spread a thin layer of the whipped cream on the bottom of the lined pan. Cover as much of the cream as possible with a layer of wafers, filling any gaps with broken wafers, to create a solid layer of wafers.\nContinue layering whipped cream and wafers until you run out or reach the top of the pan, ending with a layer of wafers. Gently cover the surface with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 to 8 hours, or preferably overnight. If you have whipped cream left over, store this in the refrigerator along with the cake.\nRemove the cake from the refrigerator prior to serving and peel off the plastic wrap. Place a serving plate over the pan and invert the cake onto the plate. Carefully remove the pan and plastic wrap lining and, if using, thinly spread the remaining whipped cream over the sides and top of the cake. Re-whip the cream if it looks too soft to spread. Sprinkle the cake with the toasted almonds, lightly pressing them into the cake.\nUsing a serrated knife, cut the cake into slices and serve.

Steps:Arrange a rack in center of oven; preheat to 425\u00b0F. Take this time to assemble all your ingredients and do your prep. Melt 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter in small bowl in a microwave or in a small saucepan over medium heat and let cool.

Beat 3 eggs to blend and pour into center of well along with 1 cup sour cream, 2 tsp. lemon zest, and remaining 5 Tbsp. melted butter (it\u2019s okay if butter has re-solidified; go ahead and scrape it in there).\nStarting in the center, whisk to blend egg mixture, then make larger circles outward to incorporate dry ingredients. Whisk several more times until batter is smooth.\nCarefully dollop large spoonfuls of batter over fruit (it\u2019s okay if pan is still warm and some fruit juices pool around batter); gently smooth surface.\nBake cake until top is golden brown and a tester or toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45\u201355 minutes.\nLet cake cool in pan 10 minutes, then use a paring knife to loosen cake from edge of pan.\nPlace a wire rack over pan, then swiftly invert rack and pan; cake should release from pan on its own. Lift cake pan off cake, peel off parchment, and marvel at your creation. If some of the cherries cling to the parchment, tuck them back into place. Let cake cool completely.\nWhisk remaining 1 cup sour cream with 1\u20132 Tbsp. sugar in a large bowl. Dollop on each slice before serving.",

Reduce oven temperature to 325\u00b0F.\nMeanwhile, heat chocolate and 1 cup oil in a medium heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water (don\u2019t let bowl touch the water), stirring often, until mixture is smooth. Remove from heat.\nPulse almonds, salt, and 1/4 cup cocoa in food processor until nuts are finely ground. Add shredded coconut and pulse a couple of times to combine.\nBeat eggs on medium speed in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment until no longer streaky, about 20 seconds. Add both sugars and vanilla, increase speed to high, and beat until mixture is pale, thick, and starts to hold the marks of the whisk, about 2 minutes (it should fall off the whisk and immediately sink back into itself). Switch to the paddle attachment and with mixer on low speed, gradually add chocolate mixture. Beat to incorporate, then mix in almond mixture. Fold batter several times with a rubber spatula, making sure to scrape the bottom and sides. Scrape batter into prepared pan; smooth top.\nBake cake until firm to the touch and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean but greasy, 35\u201345 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool 15\u201320 minutes in pan (cake might fall slightly in the center; that\u2019s okay). Run a paring knife or small offset spatula around edges of cake; invert onto rack. Carefully peel away parchment; let cool completely.\nPreheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Combine chocolate, 1 Tbsp. agave nectar, and salt in a medium bowl. Bring coconut milk to a simmer in a small saucepan over low; pour over chocolate mixture. Let sit until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes.\nMeanwhile, toss coconut flakes, almonds, sugar, and remaining 1 tsp. agave nectar on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and toast until golden, about 4 minutes. Let almond-coconut mixture cool, then break into smaller clusters.\nUsing an electric mixer on medium speed, beat chocolate mixture until it has lost its sheen and is thick enough to hold very soft peaks, 6\u20138 minutes (ganache won\u2019t be quite as thick as frosting but close).\nWorking quickly before ganache starts to set, scrape on top of cake and spread to edges with a small offset spatula or knife. Top with almond-coconut clusters.\nCake can be baked and cooled 1 day ahead. Store tightly covered at room temperature until ready to serve.",

Remove once the egg is dry.\nFree-Hand Easter Eggs: A third way to block off portions: Before dyeing, draw on the egg with a light-colored crayon or wax. If desired, once the egg is dry, the wax can be softened by holding the egg over a candle flame and then wiped off.\nTwo-Toned Easter Eggs: All three of the above methods can be used to create two-toned eggs: Dye the whole egg a light color, such as pink, and let it dry. Then wrap the egg with a rubber band, affix stickers, or draw a design in crayon. Dye the egg a second color, such as blue. Once dry, remove the rubber band, stickers, or crayon. The areas blocked off will remain the first color (in this case, pink), while the rest of the egg will turn a combination of the 2 colors (in this case, purple).\nOmbre Easter Eggs: Dip a portion of the egg in one color and another portion in another color.

Cook, stirring occasionally, until ginger is starting to brown and curl around the edges and garlic is golden, about 4 minutes. Add coriander, cumin, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring often, until spices are fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in turmeric followed by 2 cups yogurt and mix until smooth; season with salt.\nNestle legs back into pot, skin side up, in a single layer and add water just until legs are almost submerged with skin barely peeking out. Bring to a very gentle simmer, adjusting heat if needed, and cook, uncovered, until meat is very tender and just about falling off the bone, 75\u201390 minutes (the yogurt will separate and look curdled, which is fine). Let cool 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, finely grate remaining garlic clove into a small bowl. Add remaining 1 cup yogurt and stir to combine; season with salt and pepper.\nSmear yogurt mixture across a platter and scatter chickpeas over. Carefully transfer chicken legs to platter. Using a large spoon or small ladle, skim off bright yellow fat that has collected on surface of braising liquid and drizzle all over platter (it\u2019s okay if some rogue spices make it onto platter). Top with scallions and mint, then squeeze lime wedges over.",

Steps:Place chicken, celery, carrots, onions, fennel, garlic, bay leaf, and parsley and dill with stems in a large pot. Add cold water to cover by 1\". Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to low. Gently simmer, partially covered, skimming off any foam that accumulates, until chicken is very tender and falling off the bone, about 1 1/2-2 hours.\nWhile the soup is simmering, make the matzo balls: Using a fork, mix together the eggs, oil, matzo meal, seltzer water, dill, and 2 tsp. salt in a large bowl. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.\nMeanwhile, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and keep water at a simmer.\nMoisten your hands with water. Scoop out a rounded tablespoonful of chilled matzo ball batter and very gently pat into a 1\" ball (avoid squeezing too hard or rolling too much). Drop into simmering water and repeat with remaining batter. Cover pot and gently simmer until matzo balls are tender and puffed, 40-45 minutes. Drain matzo balls and return to the pot; cover and keep in a warm place.\nRemove chicken and vegetables from the chicken broth with a slotted spoon and transfer to a cutting board; let rest until cool enough to handle. Meanwhile, strain broth through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl, discarding solids. Return the strained broth to the pot. Using your fingers, remove chicken meat from bones and shred into bite-sized pieces. Slice vegetables into bite-size pieces. Place chicken and vegetables in broth, cover pot, and set aside in a warm place until ready to serve.\nTo serve, add kale to broth and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until kale softens, 3-5 minutes. Season soup generously with salt and pepper.\nDivide matzo balls among bowls and ladle soup on top. Garnish with chopped parsley and dill before serving.\nMatzo balls can be cooled to room temperature, then stored, covered, in the fridge up to 1 day. Soup can be made until just before adding kale, cooled to room temperature, then stored in a covered container in the fridge up to 1 day. Reheat, then add kale and simmer for a few minutes before serving.",

Steps:Whisk cocoa, sugar, salt, and 1 2/3 cups flour in a medium bowl. Add butter and toss to coat. Using your fingers, smash butter into dry ingredients until it nearly disappears (you shouldn\u2019t see any large bits) and mixture holds together when squeezed\u2014you\u2019re working it more than you would pie dough. Make a well in the center and add yolk and milk. Using a fork, gradually incorporate flour mixture until you\u2019ve got a shaggy dough. Knead a couple of times in bowl until no dry spots remain and dough is smooth. Flatten into a 3/4\"-thick disk, wrap tightly in plastic, and chill until firm, about 2 hours. (You can make the caramel filling during this time.)\nPreheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Let dough sit 5 minutes to soften slightly. Roll out on a lightly floured surface to a 14\" round about 1/8\" thick, dusting with more flour as needed to prevent sticking. Lift dough on one edge and throw a pinch of flour on surface. Slide bottom of tart pan under dough, positioning it roughly in the center. Fold in edges of dough so it\u2019s resting fully on insert; place inside tart ring and unfold edges so they gently slump against sides of pan and excess dough is hanging over the edges. Press dough firmly into bottom of pan with floured hands, then use a straight-sided measuring cup to firmly press sides of dough into grooves and up sides of pan. Roll pin over top edge of pan to shear off excess dough flush with pan. Reserve dough scraps for patching any potential cracks later. Prick bottom of dough all over with a fork and chill in freezer until very firm, 10\u201315 minutes.\nPlace tart pan on a rimmed baking sheet and line with a sheet of parchment paper or foil. Fill with pie weights or dried beans and bake until edges of crust are set and starting to look dry, 12\u201315 minutes. Carefully lift parchment with weights. Patch any visible cracks with reserved dough. Return crust to oven and bake until firm and dry all over, 18\u201322 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool.\nBring sugar, cream of tartar, and 1/3 cup water to a boil in a large saucepan over medium-low, stirring with a heatproof spatula until dissolved. Cook, swirling pot often but not stirring, until mixture turns deep amber and wisps of smoke rise from the surface, 8\u201310 minutes. Remove caramel from heat and immediately stir in butter a piece at a time until smooth (be careful; mixture will sputter). Gradually stir in cream, then add salt. Transfer caramel to a heatproof measuring glass (you should have about 1 1/2 cups). Let cool until warm.\nPour caramel into cooled tart shell. Chill until caramel is set, at least 1 hour.\nPlace chocolate, cream, and butter in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (bowl should not touch water). Stir with a heatproof spatula until ganache is smooth, about 5 minutes. Let cool until thickened enough to hold an indentation from a spoon.\nRemove tart from refrigerator and scrape ganache over caramel. Using a spoon, gently work ganache over surface, creating decorative swooshes and swirls. Sprinkle with sea salt; let sit until ganache has lost its sheen, 10\u201315 minutes.\nDough can be made 2 days ahead; keep chilled. Crust can be baked 1 day ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature. Caramel filling can be made 3 days ahead; cover and chill. Microwave in 20-second intervals, stirring in between, just until pourable. Caramel-filled tart can be made 1 day ahead; once it\u2019s set, cover and keep chilled. Tart can be assembled 1 day ahead. Chill until ganache is set, then cover loosely.

Continue cutting deeper into the roast, lifting and unfurling meat with your free hand, until it lies flat (be careful not to cut all the way through). Season generously on both sides with salt.\nMix eggs, chopped garlic, panko, parsley, rosemary, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and 3 oz. Parmesan in a medium bowl. Keeping fattier side of pork shoulder facing downward, smear filling all over top side. Roll up roast and tie closed in 3\u20134 places with kitchen twine.\nHeat oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-high. Sear pork roast until browned all over, 10\u201312 minutes total. Arrange tomatoes and their juices and sliced garlic all around roast and bring to a simmer. Make sure roast is turned fat side up, cover pot, and transfer to oven. Roast until a skewer easily passes through meat (a thermometer inserted into the center should register 200\u2013205\u00b0F), 4\u20135 hours. Keep covered and let rest in pot 30 minutes.\nTransfer pork roast to a cutting board and remove kitchen twine. Gently mash sauce in pot with a spoon or a potato masher (simmer it gently to thicken, if desired). Taste rag\u00f9 and season with salt if needed. Slice pork 1\" thick.\nMeanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente; drain.\nSpoon pasta into a serving dish and top with some rag\u00f9; toss to coat. Sprinkle with finely grated Parmesan. Transfer pork to a platter; spoon remaining rag\u00f9 over.\nPork can be stuffed and rolled 2 days before roasting; cover and chill. Pork can be roasted 3 days ahead; let cool, then cover and chill. Reheat gently in sauce before serving.",

Diamond Crystal or 3 Tbsp. plus 2 1/2 tsp.', '4 sprigs thyme', '4 garlic cloves, smashed', '2 tsp. black peppercorns', '1 tsp. juniper berries (optional)', '2 whole cloves', '1 large onion, halved through root end', '1 1/2 lb. dried Tarbais, corona, or cannellini beans, soaked overnight, drained', '8 oz. pancetta (leave in 1 thick piece)', '2 carrots, scrubbed, halved crosswise if large', '1 head of garlic, halved crosswise', '4 sprigs thyme', '1 bay leaf', 'Kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper', '1 1/2 lb. skinless, boneless pork shoulder (Boston butt), cut into 1\" pieces', '1 1/2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt, plus more', 'Freshly ground black pepper', '2 Tbsp. vegetable oil', '1 large onion, peeled, chopped', '1 large carrot, peeled, chopped', '4 garlic cloves, finely chopped', '4 sprigs thyme', '1 bay leaf', '1 (14.5-oz.) can crushed tomatoes', '6 cups chicken stock or low-sodium chicken broth', 'Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper', '1 lb. fresh pork sausage (such as Toulouse, sweet Italian, or unsmoked kielbasa)', '3 cups medium-fine fresh breadcrumbs, divided', '1/4 cup finely chopped parsley', '1 garlic clove, halved lengthwise', '1 lb. precooked garlic sausage', 'sliced crosswise 1/4\" thick (optional)']. Steps:Cure duck legs:\nPrick skin on duck legs all over with the tip of a paring knife. Rub legs with salt, making sure to massage into flesh and skin.\nPlace legs in a large bowl and cover with plastic wrap, pressing directly onto legs. Rest a plate on top of legs and weigh down with several 28-oz. cans. Chill at least 12 hours and up to 1 day.\nNOTE: If you\u2019re going to cook the beans and ragout tomorrow, soak the beans tonight. If not, just remember to soak them the day before you want to cook them.\nConfit duck legs:\nPreheat oven to 250\u00b0F. Evenly scatter thyme, garlic, peppercorns, and juniper berries (if using) across a large baking dish or roasting pan and add 2 Tbsp. water.\nRemove duck legs from bowl. Rinse off salt and arrange legs, skin side down, over aromatics in baking dish. Cover dish tightly with foil and weigh down with a cast-iron skillet or a heavy baking dish. Bake until fat renders out of duck and legs are submerged, about 2 hours.\nCarefully remove baking dish from oven and remove skillet and foil. Turn legs skin side up and nestle back into fat. Cover dish again with foil and continue to cook legs, unweighted, until duck meat is very tender and bones wiggle easily in joints, 2\u20132 1/2 hours longer.\nLet legs cool in fat until you can handle them, then transfer with tongs or a spider to a plate. Strain 1/4 cup fat through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl and let cool. Cover and set aside for cooking the breadcrumbs. Strain remaining fat into an airtight container; cover and reserve for another use (like roasting potatoes).\nRemove skin from legs, trying to keep as intact as possible; transfer skin to an airtight container. Cover and chill. Pull duck meat from bones, tearing into 2\" pieces; discard bones and cartilage. Place meat in another airtight container; cover and chill. You won\u2019t need the skin, meat, or fat until you\u2019re ready to assemble the cassoulet.\nDO AHEAD: Duck legs can be confited 3 weeks ahead. Transfer legs to a large nonreactive vessel; strain fat through a fine-mesh sieve over meat. Cover and chill. Let come to room temperature before using. Meat and skin can be prepared 3 days ahead; keep chilled.\nCook the beans:\nStick a clove into each onion half. Place in a large pot along with beans, pancetta, carrots, garlic, thyme, and bay leaf; pour in cold water to cover beans by 2\". Season with several grinds of pepper [3] and bring to a gentle simmer. Partially cover pot and cook beans, skimming surface occasionally and adding more water as needed to keep beans submerged and seasoning with a couple of pinches of salt after about 30 minutes, until beans are tender but not falling apart, 45\u201360 minutes for cannellini and 1\u20131\u00bd hours for Tarbais or corona. Remove pot from heat; pluck out and discard onion, carrots, garlic, thyme, and bay leaf. Transfer pancetta to a cutting board; let cool slightly, then cut into 1x1/4\" pieces. Add back to pot and let mixture cool.\nCook ragout:\nMeanwhile, sprinkle pork with 1 1/2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt and several grinds of pepper. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-high. Working in 2 batches, cook pork, turning once, until browned all over, 10\u201312 minutes per batch; transfer to a plate as you go.\nReduce heat to medium and place onion, carrot, and garlic in pot; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly browned, 8\u201310 minutes. Return pork to pot and add thyme, bay leaf, tomatoes, and stock. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, partially cover pot, and simmer gently, skimming fat occasionally, until meat is fork-tender, 1 3/4\u20132 hours. Pluck out and discard thyme and bay leaf. Let ragout cool slightly.\nCombine beans and ragout:\nUsing a slotted spoon, transfer bean mixture to pot with ragout. Add enough cooking liquid from beans just to cover. Pour remaining bean cooking liquid into an airtight container and chill; you may need it for finishing the cassoulet later. Let ragout mixture cool completely, then cover and chill at least 12 hours.\nDO AHEAD: Ragout and beans can be combined 2 days ahead. Keep chilled.\nTemper and season ragout mixture:\nRemove ragout mixture from refrigerator and skim fat from surface; discard. Cover pot and bring ragout to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat. Taste and season conservatively with salt and pepper if needed (the duck will add considerable saltiness when mixed in).\nPrepare sausage and breadcrumbs:\nRemove reserved duck meat and skin from refrigerator. Let meat come to room temperature.\nMeanwhile, arrange skin in a single layer in an 8-qt. Dutch oven or other heavy pot (the same one you\u2019ll cook the cassoulet in). Cook over low heat, turning occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, 20\u201330 minutes. Using tongs, transfer skin to paper towels and blot away excess fat.\nPrick pork sausages all over with a fork and cook in fat in same pot, turning occasionally, until browned all over and cooked through, 12\u201315 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let cool slightly. Cut into 2\" pieces.\nAdd breadcrumbs to pot and cook, stirring often, until golden in spots and starting to crisp, about 5 minutes. If breadcrumbs seem very dry or are sticking to the pot, add 1\u20132 Tbsp. reserved duck fat. Transfer breadcrumbs to a medium bowl and let cool slightly. Add parsley and toss to combine. Wipe out pot and let cool.\nLayer cassoulet:\nRub inside of cooled pot with cut sides of garlic; ladle in one-third of ragout mixture. Top with half of pork sausage, garlic sausage, and duck meat, then another third of ragout mixture. Top with remaining duck meat and sausages, then remaining ragout mixture. Liquid should come to top of beans. Add reserved bean cooking liquid if needed.\nDO AHEAD: Cassoulet can be assembled 1 day ahead; cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before proceeding. Store breadcrumbs and duck skin separately airtight at room temperature.\nBake cassoulet:\nPreheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Scatter two-thirds of breadcrumb mixture over cassoulet.\nBake, uncovered, until a golden crust forms, 25\u201330 minutes. Remove from oven and use a spoon to break up crust, pressing very gently so crust absorbs a little liquid; smooth surface. Bake until another crust forms, 25\u201330 minutes; break up again. Repeat process 2 more times (for a total of 4 times). If mixture starts to look dry, moisten with a bit of reserved bean cooking liquid when breaking up the crust.\nTop cassoulet with remaining breadcrumb mixture; bake until golden brown, 15\u201320 minutes. Let rest at least 25 minutes before serving.\nDivide cassoulet among bowls; crumble duck skin over.",

Steps:Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large saucepan over medium-high. Add shrimp heads and shells and cook, stirring occasionally, until shells and oil are bright red and shells are very fragrant, 5\u20138 minutes. Use a potato masher to press down very firmly on heads to release their juices. Stir in tomato paste and cook until it starts to brown and stick to bottom of pot, about 1 minute.

Steps:Combine all of the marinade ingredients together in a bowl or wide dish with a whisk or fork.\nPeel the tough brown waxy skin from the cassava and discard. Your cassava root should be firm and white, not gray or mushy.

Steps:To make the vegan egg, drain the tofu of excess water. Place in a high-powered blender with the nondairy milk, nutritional yeast, tapioca flour, turmeric, garlic and onion powders, salt, and pepper. Blend on high until smooth. The batter should be the consistency of a thick pancake batter. Add a bit more nondairy milk if you need to thin it out. Stir in the chopped chives.\nHeat a nonstick pan over medium heat and add a bit of vegan butter. Let it melt and spread it around the frying surface. Pour approximately 1/3 cup of the batter onto the pan and gently spread out to a 6-to 7-inch circle. Cook on the first side for 4 to 5 minutes; the patty should be bubbling and look slightly cooked through and darker in color before flipping. Flip and cook for another 4 to 5 minutes. Fold the patty in half and then in half again, so it looks like you\u2019ve folded a thick crepe, and cook for another minute on each side to make sure that the middle is thoroughly cooked. Set each folded patty aside on a plate and cover to keep warm. Butter the pan before pouring the next 1/3 cup of batter into the pan. As you go, you might need to lower the heat or adjust cook times, as the pan will get hotter.\nWhen you\u2019re on your last egg patty, set the oven to broil and place the English muffins on a baking sheet. Generously butter each side of the muffins and place 1 piece of cheese on each of the bottom halves. Toast under the broiler for a couple of minutes until the cheese is melted and the muffins are golden brown. Watch closely so the muffins don\u2019t burn!\nPlace the bacon strips in the pan once the egg patties are done just to heat through.\nTo assemble each sandwich, place an egg patty on top of the cheese, add a tomato slice and as many bacon strips as you want, and finish with the top half of the muffin. The patties can be made ahead and heated through in a pan or the oven or in a microwave before serving. You can also store extra batter in the fridge for up to 4 days.",

Steps:Preheat an empty 5- to 8-quart slow cooker on HIGH for 10 to 15 minutes while you\u2019re getting everything ready. Combine the butter and 1/2 cup of the miso in a medium bowl and mash them together to make a uniform mixture. Put the potatoes into the bottom of the slow cooker and add a small dollop of the miso butter; stir to coat. Season the potatoes lightly with salt. Pat the chicken dry and rub the remaining butter all over the chicken, and especially under the skin of the breasts directly on the breast meat: To do this, gently loosen the skin and separate it from the breast meat by sliding your fingers under the skin, then tuck some butter in there. Set the chicken on top of the potatoes.\nCover the slow cooker and reduce the heat to LOW. Cook for 5 to 6 hours (the larger the slow cooker, the shorter the cook time), until the chicken breast registers 160\u00b0F internal temperature on an instant-read or probe thermometer when you check the top of the breast. Also check that the thickest part of the thigh and the juice in the cavity register at least 165\u00b0F. Cooking the chicken much beyond these temperatures will result in dry meat, so this is a case when pulling out the thermometer really makes a difference.\nTurn off and uncover the slow cooker and let the chicken rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the broiler on high and position a rack 6 inches from the heat source (if that\u2019s how your broiler works). Line a baking sheet with foil or parchment paper. In a small bowl mix together the honey and remaining 1/4 cup miso.\nUsing tongs slung through the cavity of the chicken and your hands to support it, carefully transfer the chicken from the slow cooker to a cutting board, leaving the drippings behind. Remove the potatoes from the slow cooker with a slotted spoon and put them on the prepared baking sheet. Carve the chicken and put the pieces on the baking sheet skin side up. Drizzle the chicken all over with the miso-honey mixture, then broil the potatoes and chicken until the chicken skin is caramelized and crisp, dark golden brown, about 5 minutes. (Don\u2019t walk away; the skin will burn quickly because of the sugar in the honey.)\nPut the chicken pieces and potatoes on a serving platter (or leave them on the baking sheet and serve them straight from that) and drizzle a little juice from the slow cooker over the whole thing. Top with chives and serve with lemon wedges.",

Steps:Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add 2 large palmfuls of salt (about 1/2 cup). While you\u2019re waiting for the water to boil, place rice in a strainer or sieve and rinse with lukewarm water, swishing rice around with your hands to get rid of excess starch. Continue to rinse until water from rice runs clear.\nAdd rice to pot and give it a few stirs to prevent rice from sticking to the bottom. Cook, stirring occasionally, until rice begins to rise to the top and is tender but still has a slight bite to it, 6\u20138 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water.\nMeanwhile, melt butter in a medium skillet over medium-low heat. Cook barberries, stirring often, until plumped slightly and warmed through, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in rose water, if using.\nPlace rack in lower third of oven; preheat to 400\u00b0F. Combine saffron and 2 Tbsp. hot water in a large bowl. Let sit 10 minutes to allow saffron to steep and draw out as much color as possible. Mix in egg yolks, yogurt, 1/2 cup oil, and 2 tsp. salt. Scatter rice over yogurt mixture and gently toss to ensure every grain is coated.\nCoat a 10\"-diameter glass pie dish with oil (glass lets you check on the color from underneath). Add half of rice mixture and use the palms of your hands or a measuring cup to gently pack and compact rice into dish. Scatter half of barberries over and top with remaining rice. Press down again, this time more firmly (this helps with unmolding).\nCover dish tightly with foil and bake until rice on the bottom and around edges is a deep golden brown, 65\u201380 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes; discard foil. Loosen the rice around the edges using the point of a knife. Place a large plate on top and invert rice onto plate like a cake.

Add 1 more Tbsp. ice water, season with kosher salt, and pulse again to combine. This whole process will occupy 8\u201310 minutes. Take your time! Transfer toum to a medium bowl.\nPlace a rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 400\u00b0F. Place sweet potatoes in a large heavy skillet, preferably cast iron. The pan should be large enough so that sweet potatoes cover only half of the pan. Pour in just enough water to barely coat bottom of pan. Cover tightly with foil and bake sweet potatoes until tender, 30\u201335 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let cool; reserve skillet. Slice sweet potatoes in half lengthwise.\nReturn reserved skillet to rack and heat 20 minutes. Remove skillet from oven and swirl 2 Tbsp. butter around in pan to coat. Add sweet potatoes, cut side down, and roast until edges are browned underneath and crisp, 18\u201325 minutes.\nSpoon some toum on a plate or in shallow bowl and arrange sweet potatoes on top (save extra toum for another use). Stir remaining 2 Tbsp. butter and honey in skillet and place over medium heat to warm. Drizzle honey butter over sweet potatoes. Sprinkle with nigella seeds, if using, and sea salt.",

Steps:In a bowl, mix the kefir with 1/2 cup of the kosher salt. Set aside.\nTrim and cut the chicken into 10 pieces: 2 drumsticks; 2 thighs; 2 wings; and 2 breasts, each cut in half (leave the breasts on the rib cage). Pat all the pieces dry with a paper towel, then add the chicken to the kefir mixture. Cover and let sit overnight in the refrigerator. When ready to cook, pull the bowl out of the refrigerator about 30 minutes prior to cooking.\nPreheat the oven to 425\u00b0F. Set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet near the stove.\nPlace a 9-inch cast-iron pan on the stovetop and pour in the grapeseed oil. Begin warming the oil over medium-high heat. In a bowl, mix together the panko, flour, paprika, black pepper, cayenne, and remaining 1/2 cup kosher salt.\nRemove one piece of chicken at a time from the kefir marinade and dredge it in the panko/flour mixture, making sure that all surfaces are covered. Lift the piece of chicken up, gently shake it off, and place on a plate. Repeat until all chicken pieces are coated.\nTake a small amount of the panko/flour mixture and place it in the hot oil in the cast-iron pan. It should bubble up around the sides and brown slowly. If it browns too quickly, turn the heat down and wait a few minutes and try again. If it does not bubble at all, turn the heat up, wait a few minutes and try again.\nOnce the oil is at the right temperature, place about half of the chicken pieces in the pan, leaving room between the pieces. You should be able to fry all the chicken in two batches. When one side of a piece of chicken is brown, 7 to 10 minutes, gently flip it in the pan using tongs or a slotted spatula. Repeat on the other side until golden brown. Remove each piece from the pan once browned and place on the rack in the baking sheet. Repeat until all pieces are browned. Place the baking sheet pan in the oven and bake for about 15 more minutes. Remove from the oven and sprinkle each piece with a touch of sea salt.",

Steps:In a medium saut\u00e9 pan, heat 1/2 cup of the olive oil over medium- high heat until slightly shimmering. Add the shiitake slices, spreading them evenly around the pan. Now leave those mushrooms alone! Do not touch them until that sizzling sound quiets down; this will help them develop a beautiful golden brown caramelization on one side. Once that happens, give the pan a stir with a wooden spoon, loosening all the mushrooms. Cook for a few minutes more and season with a pinch of sea salt. (Do not salt until the end, as salting draws out moisture in the pan and prevents caramelization.) Remove the mushrooms from the pan and set aside in a bowl or plate to cool.\nTrim the kale off of its stem and cut into thin strips. In a medium saut\u00e9 pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and red onion. When the garlic is slightly browned, add the kale and saut\u00e9 until soft, 3 to 4 minutes. (Add a small amount of water if the kale begins to stick or turn too brown.)

Let the braising liquid cool slightly, then strain the liquid into a bowl (discard the solids).\nSkim off any fat that has risen to the top.\nPur\u00e9e the braising liquid in a blender.\nTo make the sauce, heat 2 tablespoons oil in the Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the flour and stir to combine with the oil. Stir in the remaining 1/4 cup cider and the tomato paste and mix well.\nReturn the braising liquid to the pot along with the remaining 1 1/2 cups beef broth and the remaining 2 thyme sprigs. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, until the sauce is thickened.\nSeason the sauce with salt and pepper to taste. Remove the thyme sprigs.\nTo serve, slice the pot roast, arrange the vegetables around it, and pour the sauce over the top.\nIn many pot roast recipes, there is an element of alcohol. In mine, I use hard cider, but you can also try red wine, a heavy beer, or\u2014for your Irish friends\u2014Guinness. The booze gives the meat an extra dimension but won\u2019t get the family hammered.",

Add the garlic and ginger and saut\u00e9 for 1 minute longer. Add the beer, gochujang, ketchup, soy sauce, brown sugar, fish sauce, and sesame oil. Scrape the mixture into the pressure cooker if you have used a skillet.\nCover and cook on high pressure for 90 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally for 20 minutes, and then release the remaining pressure manually.\nTo make the kimchi coleslaw, combine the cabbage, kimchi, both oils, lime juice, and salt in a large bowl and toss well. Taste, and add more salt or lime juice if needed.\nTransfer the beef to a plate or a rimmed cutting board and tent with foil to keep warm. Set the pressure cooker to saut\u00e9 and simmer the sauce for 15 to 20 minutes, until it is reduced by half or two-thirds (remember that it thickens as it cools). Use a fat separator to skim off the fat, or let the sauce settle and spoon the fat off the top. Serve the sauce alongside the beef, with the kimchi coleslaw.\nCut the beef into 6 to 8 pieces instead of 3 or 4 pieces. Marinate and brown as in steps 1 and 2. Place the meat in the pot and cover with the saut\u00e9ed onion mixture from step 3. Cook on high for 7 to 9 hours or low for 10 to 12 hours.",

Steps:In a mortar, combine the lemongrass, ginger, shallots, and garlic; pound to a semismooth paste. Stir in the oil, oyster sauce, fish sauce, turmeric, and the 1/3 cup coconut milk and mix well. Reserve 1/4 cup of this mixture and set aside. Transfer the rest to a large mixing bowl and add the short ribs. Toss the ribs to coat, cover the bowl, and let them marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours (you can get away with marinating for 6 hours at a minimum, though the satay will have less depth of flavor).\nWhen it is time to cook the ribs, preheat your grill until very hot. I highly recommend cooking satay on an outdoor grill over charcoal briquettes, but gas will suffice (cook them indoors in a grill pan only if you have a very good exhaust system, since they generate a lot of smoke). Make the baste by mixing the reserved 1/4 cup marinade with the 1/3 cup coconut milk. Grill the ribs for about 2 minutes on each side (a little more or less, depending on how you like your meat). As they cook, brush the ribs with the basting liquid and a sprinkling of salt. Let the cooked ribs rest for 2 minutes before serving with the satay peanut sauce and cucumber ajat.

Diced caramelized onions, Gruy\u00e8re cheese, and chopped chives. Drizzle on beef broth instead of butter.

        "content": "We will be making Kale or Chard Pie, here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['2 tablespoons butter, plus more as needed', 'About 8 large kale or chard leaves, rinsed well and thinly sliced', '1 onion, sliced', 'Salt and pepper', '1/4 cup chopped mixed fresh herbs (like parsley, thyme, chervil, and/or chives)', '6 eggs', '1 cup whole-milk yogurt or sour cream', '3 tablespoons mayonnaise', '1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour', '1/2 teaspoon baking powder']. Steps:Heat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Melt the butter in a large skillet, preferably nonstick, over medium heat. After a minute, add the kale and onion. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the leaves are quite tender, about 10 minutes; do not brown. Remove from the heat, add the herbs, then taste and adjust the seasoning.\nMeanwhile, hard-boil 3 of the eggs; shell and coarsely chop them. Add to the cooked kale and let cool while you make the batter.\nWhisk together the yogurt, mayonnaise, and the remaining 3 eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Add the flour and baking powder and mix until completely incorporated. Lightly butter a 12 \u00d7 9-inch or comparable ceramic or glass baking dish. Spread half the batter over the bottom, then top with the kale filling; spread the remaining batter over the kale, using your fingers or a rubber spatula to make sure there are no gaps in the top layer.\nBake for 45 minutes, until the crust is shiny and golden brown. Let the pie cool for at least 15 minutes before slicing it into as many squares or rectangles as you like. Serve warm or at room temperature.\nAn Eastern European classic: Replace the kale with 1 head Savoy or green cabbage, cored and thinly sliced, and the mixed herbs with 2/3 cup chopped fresh dill.\nMeaty in flavor and texture and can be made with almost any cooked grain, including wheat and rye berries: Substitute 3 cups chopped or sliced mushrooms for the kale, and add 1 cup cooked kasha to the mushroom mixture along with the herbs.",

        "content": "We will be making Paella with Tomatoes and Eggs, here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['3 1/2 cups vegetable stock or water, plus more if needed', 'Large pinch saffron threads (optional)', '1 pound fresh tomatoes, cored, cut into thick wedges, and seeded', 'Salt and pepper', '4 tablespoons olive oil', '1 onion, chopped', '1 tablespoon minced garlic', '1 tablespoon tomato paste', '2 teaspoons smoked or other paprika', '2 cups Spanish or other short-grain white rice or parcooked short-grain brown rice', '4\u20136 eggs', 'Chopped fresh parsley for garnish']. Steps:Heat the oven to 450\u00b0F. Warm the stock in a medium saucepan with the saffron if you\u2019re using it. Put the tomatoes in a bowl, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and drizzle them with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Toss gently to coat.\nPut the remaining oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and paprika and cook for a minute more. Add the rice and cook, stirring occasionally, until it\u2019s shiny, another minute or 2. Carefully add the stock and stir until just combined.\nPut the tomato wedges on top of the rice and drizzle with the juices that accumulated in the bottom of the bowl. Use a large spoon to make 4 to 6 indentations in the rice and carefully crack an egg into each. Put the pan in the oven and roast, undisturbed, for 15 minutes. Check to see if the rice is dry and just tender. If not, return the pan to the oven for another 5 minutes. If the rice looks too dry at this point and still isn\u2019t quite done, add a small amount of stock, wine, or water. When the rice is ready, turn off the oven and let it sit for at least 5 and up to 15 minutes.\nRemove the pan from the oven and sprinkle with parsley. If you like, put the pan over high heat for a few minutes to develop a bit of a bottom crust before serving.\nInstead of tomatoes and eggs, use 1 pound eggplant, peeled if you like, and cubed. In Step 1, increase the oil to 2 tablespoons.\nInstead of tomatoes and eggs, use 1 pound fresh mushrooms like cremini (sometimes called \u201cbaby bellas\u201d) or shiitake. Trim the stems and save them for another use, but leave the caps whole. Proceed with the recipe, putting the caps on top of the rice, smooth side up.\nYou\u2019ll have to pile the spinach up on top of the rice, but it will cook down and form a lovely green topping: Instead of tomatoes and eggs, use 1 pound fresh spinach, rinsed, trimmed of thick stems, and chopped. When you put it in the bowl with the olive oil, add 1 tablespoon minced lemon zest.\nYou could also make this with limas or edamame: Instead of the tomatoes and eggs, use 1 cup shelled and peeled fava beans (frozen are fine).",

Steps:Put the oil in a large pot over medium heat. When it's hot, add the carrots, celery, onion, potatoes, garlic, and mushrooms. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, cover, and cook, undisturbed, until you hear the vegetables sizzle, 3 to 5 minutes. Uncover, stir once or twice, and cook, stirring only enough to prevent burning until the vegetables release their liquid and begin to brown, 15 to 20 minutes. (If you have more time, keep going another 15 to 20 minutes or until they're even darker.)\nAdd 10 cups water, the parsley, and the bay leaves. Bring to a boil, then adjust the heat so the mixture bubbles steadily but gently. Cook until the vegetables are very tender, anywhere from 15 to 60 minutes depending how much time you can spare.\nStrain through a fine-mesh strainer.

Add the stock, soy sauce, vinegar, half the cilantro (save therest for garnish), mushrooms, and 1 cup water. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat so the stock bubbles gently. Cook, partially covered, until you are happy with the concentration of flavor, 30 to 60 minutes.\nPut the rice vermicelli in a large bowl, sprinkle with salt, and cover with the boiling water. Soak until the noodles are barely tender; start checking after 3 minutes. Drain the noodles, then rinse them and the bowl with cold water to cool down. Return the noodles to the bowl, add enough cold water to cover, and let sit until you\u2019re ready to serve.\nStrain the broth through a fine-meshed strainer, return it to the pot, and keep at a gentle bubble. Taste and adjust the seasoning, adding more soy sauce if you\u2019d like. (You can make the broth to this point, cool, and store it in the refrigerator for several days or the freezer for a few months. Return it to a boil and keep hot until time to serve.)\nPrepare any additional toppings from the list that follows (or whatever else you\u2019d like) and put them in bowls or platters. Drain the noodles and divide them among big bowls; ladle some broth over the noodles. Garnish with the scallions, limes, and sprigs of the reserved cilantro.

Steps:Set the chicken out at room temperature for 30 minutes before cooking.\nPreheat the oven to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C). Position a rack in the top third of your oven.\nPlace your largest cast-iron skillet in the oven for 15 minutes. Pat the chicken breasts dry and generously season them on all sides with salt and pepper. Carefully remove the hot skillet from the oven and place it on the stovetop. Add the grapeseed oil to the skillet and heat it over medium-high heat until the oil has a subtle ripple effect. You want the oil to be very hot. Working in two batches, cook the chicken, skin-side down, until the skin is crispy and golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain off all but 1 tablespoon of oil from the pan.\nRemove the chicken from the skillet and set it onto a plate as you build your sauce. Over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in the skillet and add the shallots. Cook the shallots undisturbed for 5 to 6 minutes, until they are caramelized and golden. Add the garlic, a few thyme sprigs, 1 tablespoon of the butter, and season with salt and pepper. Toss the shallots and continue to cook until they begin to soften, 5 to 7 minutes. Deglaze the pan with the wine and reduce it by half. Add a few more thyme sprigs and the stock. Simmer the sauce over medium to low heat for 15 minutes, until reduced slightly. Check for seasoning and add the dates and olives to the sauce.\nReturn the chicken breasts to the skillet, skin-side up, and place it in the oven. Roast the chicken until it\u2019s just cooked through, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the breast should register 160\u00b0F (70\u00b0C).\nTransfer the chicken breasts to a plate; set them aside and keep warm. Return the skillet to the stovetop over medium to low heat and add the vinegar to the sauce. Simmer until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove it from the heat and stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and the lemon juice. Check and adjust the seasoning. Return the chicken to the skillet and serve it immediately, garnished with the remaining thyme and the lemon zest.",

Divide caramel between two 8\"-diameter shallow ceramic ovenproof baking dishes or two 9x5\" loaf pans, preferably glass or ceramic, to create a 1/8\"\u20131/4\" deep layer. Let cool.\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 275\u00b0F. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Pur\u00e9e eggs and egg yolks with remaining 2/3 cup sugar in a blender until smooth and sugar is dissolved, about 1 minute. Transfer to a large bowl and gently mix in cream, milk, salt, and reserved grapefruit zest; let sit 5 minutes. Strain into a large measuring glass. Divide custard between prepared baking dishes.\nLine a roasting pan with a thick kitchen towel; this will keep baking dishes from sliding and will insulate flan, preventing it from overcooking. Set dishes on towel and place roasting pan in oven. Pour very hot water into pan until it reaches the same level as flan in baking dishes. Bake flan until it looks set like Jell-O (it will wobble when gently shaken), 40\u201355 minutes. Transfer dishes to a wire rack; let flan cool.\nRun a small knife around edges of flan to loosen. Invert onto a platter and top with reserved grapefruit segments.\nFlan can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Unmold and bring to room temperature before serving.",

Ingredients:['2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling', '1 onion, thinly sliced', '1 bay leaf', 'Kosher salt', '1 cup Castelvetrano olives, pitted, quartered', '1/4 cup drained capers', '1/4 cup raisins', '6 tablespoons dark rum', '2 tablespoons fresh lime juice', '4 (6-ounce) salmon fillets, patted dry', 'Freshly ground black pepper', '4 tablespoons coarsely chopped cilantro, divided, plus more for serving', 'Lime wedges (for serving)']. Steps:Preheat oven to 275\u00b0F. Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-low. Add onion, bay leaf, and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring often and reducing heat if onion is browning too fast, until onion is golden brown, 25\u201330 minutes.\nAdd olives, capers, raisins, and 2 Tbsp. water to skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until olives are softened, about 4 minutes. Add rum and cook until liquid is evaporated, about 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and stir in lime juice and 1 Tbsp. water. If needed, add a splash or two more of water so mixture is saucy; season with salt.\nSeason salmon with salt and pepper. Cut four large sheets of parchment paper. Working with 1 sheet, spoon one-quarter of sauce onto the center of paper; scatter 1 Tbsp. cilantro over. Create a well in the sauce the size of a salmon fillet and place fish in well; drizzle with oil. Gather edges of parchment up and over salmon and tie tightly closed with kitchen twine. Set on a rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with remaining parchment paper, sauce, salmon, and 3 Tbsp. cilantro.\nBake packets until salmon is cooked through, 20\u201322 minutes for medium (go 2 minutes longer for well-done).

        "content": "We will be making Monkey Bread, here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['1 cup (2 sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces, plus more for bowl', '1/3 cup whole milk', '1 1/4-ounce envelope active dry yeast (about 2 1/4 tsp.)', '3 cups (or more) all-purpose flour', '3 tablespoons sugar', '1 teaspoons kosher salt', '4 large eggs, room temperature', '3/4 cup granulated sugar', '1 tablespoon ground cinnamon', '6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, slightly cooled, plus more for pan', 'Sanding or granulated sugar (for pan)', 'Prepared caramel sauce (for serving)', 'A 10-inch tube pan or 10-cup Bundt pan']. Steps:Beat 1 cup butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-low speed until butter is smooth and pliable but still cold, about 1 minute. Scrape into a medium bowl; set aside. Save mixer bowl because you\u2019re going to use it again in a minute (no need to wash).\nGently heat milk in a small saucepan over low until warm to the touch but not steaming hot. It should be 110\u00b0F\u2013115\u00b0F. Whisk milk and yeast in a small bowl to dissolve yeast, then let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes.\nMeanwhile, whisk flour, sugar, and salt in reserved mixer bowl to combine. Add yeast mixture and eggs, fit bowl back onto mixer, and beat on low speed with dough hook, gradually increasing mixer speed to medium as dry ingredients are incorporated, until dough comes together around hook. Continue to mix on medium speed until dough is smooth, elastic, and no longer sticking to the sides of the bowl, about 5 minutes. Add more flour by the tablespoonful as needed if dough isn\u2019t pulling away from bowl cleanly.\nWith motor running, gradually add reserved butter about a tablespoonful at a time, waiting until it is absorbed before adding more. This process can take several minutes, so be patient. When you\u2019re done adding the butter, the dough will be extremely smooth, soft, and supple but not sticky. Place dough in a large buttered bowl and cover. Let sit in a warm, draft-free spot until nearly doubled in size, 55\u201365 minutes.\nUncover dough and punch down several times to deflate. Line a 13x9\" baking dish with plastic wrap, leaving generous overhang on all sides. Place dough in pan and press into an even layer, working all the way to the sides of the pan. Fold plastic up and over dough, eliminating air pockets between dough and plastic. Chill dough in freezer until firm to the touch, 20\u201330 minutes.\nMix granulated sugar and cinnamon in a medium bowl to combine. Lightly brush tube pan with butter. Sprinkle with sanding sugar, tapping out excess; set aside. Remove dough from freezer and peel back plastic. Brush entire surface with melted butter and sprinkle generously with some cinnamon sugar. Shake excess sugar back into bowl, then invert baking pan and turn out dough onto work surface sugar side down. Remove plastic; discard. Brush other side of dough with butter and sprinkle with more cinnamon sugar. Use a pizza cutter or a chef\u2019s knife to cut dough into a 12x6 grid.\nWorking relatively quickly so dough doesn\u2019t become too soft, separate pieces and, working one at a time, roll lightly between your palms into balls, dusting with more cinnamon sugar as needed to prevent sticking. Place in prepared tube pan as you go. Cover pan with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm, draft-free spot until pieces have swelled to nearly doubled in size, 40\u201350 minutes. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0 a little before monkey bread is ready to bake.\nRemove plastic from pan and bake monkey bread until golden brown, 25\u201335 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes, then use a small offset spatula to loosen monkey bread from sides of pan. Pull bottom out from pan and use spatula to loosen bread from bottom. Slide bread back into pan; invert onto a plate and remove pan. Place a wire rack over bread and invert right side up onto rack. If using a Bundt pan, just invert directly onto wire rack. Let cool at least 15 minutes before serving.\nPour about 1/2 cup caramel sauce over monkey bread if desired. Serve with more sauce alongside for dipping.\nDough can be made 1 day ahead. After punching down, pat into plastic-lined pan and chill in refrigerator instead of freezer.",

Steps:Place a 10\" cast-iron skillet in oven; preheat oven to 475\u00b0F. Lay your hands on another heavy skillet or saucepan the same diameter or smaller and tear off an 8\" piece of foil; set aside near stove.\nMix cumin, turmeric, paprika, and 1 tsp. salt in a small bowl. Brace yourself: This next step requires some light butchery, but it\u2019s easy. Place chicken skin side down on a cutting board and find the short row of small rib bones near the outer edge of the breast. Grip them with your fingers and pull them off (or use a paring knife or shears). Next: along the center line where the breast was cut in half, there\u2019s a dark, vaguely rectangular bone\u2014it almost looks like an anvil. Sometimes it\u2019s in one piece, or both sides will have a half of it. It doesn\u2019t matter: Grip the bone with your fingers and pull it out, then tease out the strip of flexible cartilage just below it. All done! Now the chicken will lay flat in the pan, which is why it cooks so quickly.\nSeason both sides of chicken with salt, then with all of the spice rub. Remove hot skillet from oven and set over medium-high heat. Add oil, then lay chicken into pan, skin side down. Use a spatula to firmly press chicken against surface, then add 1 lime to pan, placing sides down. Cook until skin is starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer skillet to oven, lay reserved foil over chicken, then weight with second pan. Cook 10 minutes.\nRemove pan from oven and turn chicken over; cook second side in residual heat 1 minute.

Ingredients:['1 (4\u20135-pound) skin-on, boneless pork belly', 'Kosher salt', '1 tablespoon vegetable oil', '1 (12-ounce) bottle unseasoned rice vinegar', '12 garlic cloves, chopped', '6\u201312 green Thai chiles, lightly crushed but left whole', '2 serrano chiles, torn into small pieces', '4 (12-oz.) bottles hard apple cider', '2 tablespoons honey']. Steps:Season pork generously with salt. Set, skin side up, on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Chill at least 12 hours and up to 2 days.\nPreheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Pour 4 cups water into baking sheet with pork. Rub pork skin with oil; season with more salt. Roast, adding more water to pan as needed, until skin is golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of pork registers 195\u00b0F\u2013200\u00b0F, 1 1/2\u20131 3/4 hours.\nMeanwhile, pour out 1/2 cup vinegar from bottle (save for another use). Remove pouring spout from bottle and add garlic, chiles, and a large pinch of salt. Cover and shake to distribute; let sit until ready to serve. (Or, combine in a glass jar or bowl).\nBring hard cider and honey to a boil in a large saucepan; cook until thickened and very syrupy, 30\u201345 minutes.\nIncrease oven temperature to 450\u00b0F. Continue to roast pork until skin is browned and puffed, 15\u201320 minutes (add a few more splashes of water to baking sheet if juices are scorching). Transfer rack with pork to a cutting board; let rest 20 minutes.\nPour off fat from baking sheet and add 1/2 cup water, scraping up browned bits. Return baking sheet to oven for a few minutes if needed to help loosen browned bits. Stir into reduced cider mixture.\nRemove skin from pork, using the tip of a knife to get it started (it should come off in 1 large piece with a little help). Slice pork lengthwise into 2\"-wide strips, then crosswise into 1/2\"-thick pieces. Transfer to a platter and drizzle with reduced cider mixture. Break skin into large pieces and arrange on top; place a few chiles from vinegar around. Serve with chile vinegar.\nChile vinegar can be made 1 week ahead. Store at room temperature.",

Ingredients:['5 garlic cloves, peeled', '1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper', '1 tablespoon ground allspice', '1 tablespoon kosher salt', '1 tablespoon light brown sugar', '3 tablespoons rosemary leaves, plus 6 sprigs', '2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing', '2 large pork tenderloins (about 3 pounds)', '12 ounces thin-sliced bacon (about 12 slices)', 'Cranberry sauce (for serving; optional)']. Steps:Pulse garlic, pepper, allspice, salt, brown sugar, 3 Tbsp. rosemary leaves, and 2 Tbsp. oil in a food processor until a paste forms. Alternatively, finely chop garlic and 3 Tbsp. rosemary leaves and transfer to a small bowl; stir in pepper, allspice, salt, brown sugar, and 2 Tbsp. oil.\nRub garlic paste all over pork. Let sit at least 30 minutes, or cover and chill up to overnight.\nArrange a rack in top third of oven; preheat to 425\u00b0F. Wrap each tenderloin in bacon, working in a spiral from top to bottom and letting each layer overlap slightly, until completely covered (about 5 bacon slices per tenderloin). Secure any exposed bacon slice ends with toothpicks.\nArrange 6 rosemary sprigs on a rimmed baking sheet. Arrange pork over. Brush tops of tenderloins with oil. Roast pork until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 140\u00b0F for medium-rare (about 20 minutes) or 145\u00b0 for medium, (about 25 minutes). Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes before slicing. Serve with cranberry sauce alongside, if using.\nPork can be rubbed 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.",

        "content": "We will be making Not-Quite-Bonnie's Rugelach, here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['1 1/4 cups (160 g) all-purpose flour', '1/8 tsp salt', '1/4 tsp baking powder', 'Finely grated zest of 1 small lemon (3/4 tsp)', 'Scraped seeds of 1/4 vanilla pod', '1/2 cup plus 1 tbsp (125 g) unsalted butter, fridge-cold, cut roughly into 1-inch/3-cm cubes', '4 1/2 oz (125 g) cream cheese, fridge-cold', '1/3 cup (40 g) walnut halves', '1/2 packed cup plus 1 tbsp (100 g) light brown sugar', '1/2 tsp ground cinnamon', '5 1/4 oz (150 g) store-bought quince paste (membrillo)', '1 tsp lemon juice', '1 large egg, lightly beaten', '1/2 tbsp demerara sugar']. Steps:To make the pastry, place the flour, salt, baking powder, lemon zest and vanilla seeds in a food processor and pulse for about 15 seconds to combine. Add the butter and pulse for a few seconds more, until the mixture has the texture of fresh breadcrumbs. Add the cream cheese and process just until the dough comes together in a ball around the blade; be careful not to overprocess or the pastry will be tough. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for a few seconds, just to bring it together.\nDivide the pastry in two, cover each half loosely in plastic wrap, then press to flatten into disks. Transfer to the fridge for 1 hour.\nPreheat the oven to 350\u00b0F/180\u00b0C. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.\nTo make the filling, spread the walnuts out on a rimmed baking sheet and roast for 5 minutes. Remove from the oven, set aside to cool, then chop finely and place in a small bowl with the brown sugar and cinnamon. Mix together and set aside.\nIn a separate bowl, combine the quince paste and lemon juice to form a smooth paste. (If your quince paste is very firm, warm it gently over low heat to soften [or heat for 10 seconds in a microwave], until the texture is thick like jam but spreadable, then set aside to cool before using).\nTake one of the pieces of dough from the fridge and roll out on a lightly floured work surface to form a 9 1/2-inch/24-cm circle, about 1/8 inch/3 mm thick. Use a small spatula or the back of a spoon to spread half of the quince paste evenly over the surface and then sprinkle with half of the sugar-nut mixture. Using a sharp knife or a pizza wheel, if you have one, cut the dough as though you are slicing a cake into twelve equal triangles. The best way to get even-sized triangles is to cut it first into quarters, then each quarter into thirds. One at a time, roll each wedge quite tightly, starting from the wide outside edge and working toward the point of the triangle, so that the filling is enclosed. Place them on the lined baking sheets, seam side down, spaced about 1 inch/3 cm apart. Repeat the rolling process with the remaining disk of dough and filling, then chill the rugelachs in the fridge for 30 minutes before baking.\nIncrease the oven temperature to 400\u00b0F/200\u00b0C.\nWhen ready to bake, lightly brush the tops of the rugelachs with the beaten egg and sprinkle with the demerara sugar. Bake for 20\u201325 minutes, rotating the sheets halfway through, until golden brown all over. Don\u2019t worry if some of the filling oozes out; this will add a lovely toffee taste to the edges of the cookies. Remove from the oven and allow to rest on the sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.\nThe pastry can be made a day ahead and kept in the fridge, or frozen for up to 3 months (remember to thaw it overnight in the fridge before using). The rolled rugelach can also be frozen (before glazing) for up to 3 months. When you are ready to bake them, brush with the glaze and bake from frozen, adding an extra minute or two to the cooking time.\nThese will keep for up to 4 days in an open container, separated by pieces of parchment paper, and the whole thing wrapped loosely in aluminum foil. Don\u2019t keep in an airtight container; the sugar will weep if you do and turn the rugelach soft and sticky.",

Steps:Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F/190\u00b0C.\nSpread the almonds out on a small rimmed baking sheet and roast in the oven for 5\u20137 minutes, until lightly browned. Set aside to cool. Line two large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.\nPlace 1/4 cup/50 g of the sugar in a small saucepan with the water and stir to combine. Cook over high heat for about 4 minutes, until it has turned a light golden brown; do not stir, just gently shake the pan to help the sugar dissolve. Add the almonds and cook for 1 minute, so the nuts are coated and the caramel turns dark, without burning. Pour the mixture onto one of the lined baking sheets and set aside until cool.\nOnce cool, break the praline into smaller pieces, place in a food processor and process to form a rough powder. Remove from the machine, place in a shallow bowl and combine with the spices, orange zest and salt. Set aside.\nSpread the remaining sugar out on the second lined baking sheet and place in the oven for 7 minutes, until the sugar is hot. Remove from the oven and lower the temperature to 275\u00b0F/130\u00b0C. As soon as the sugar is out of the oven, place the egg whites in the bowl of an electric mixer with the whisk attachment in place and beat on high speed until they begin to froth up. Carefully add the hot sugar to the egg whites, 1 tbsp at a time, and continue beating for 7\u20138 minutes until the mixture is completely cold. At this point it should be silky and thick and keep its shape when you lift a little bit from the bowl.\n. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper. Use an extra-large serving spoon to scoop up some meringue, and use another large spoon to help shape it into a rough ball the size of a large apple. Sprinkle some praline over half the meringue ball, then place on the baking sheet, repeat with the rest of the mixture, spacing the balls as far apart as possible, as they will increase in size.\nPlace the meringues in the oven for 2\u20132 1/2 hours. Check that they are done by lifting them from the baking sheet and gently tapping to make sure the outside is completely firm and the center is only a little soft. Remove from the oven and leave on the baking sheet to cool.\nThese will keep for up to 10 days. If you are not hanging them on the tree, wrap them loosely in aluminum foil and keep at room temperature.",

Steps:Place the butter, sugar and molasses in the bowl of an electric mixer with the paddle attachment in place. Beat on medium speed until smooth and incorporated. Add the egg yolk and continue to beat until fully combined.\nSift the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, salt and pepper into a bowl. Turn the speed of the mixer to low, and add the dry ingredients to the butter and molasses. Once the mix comes together, tip the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead gently. Roll out the dough so that it is about 1/4 inch/ 0.5 cm thick. If the dough is very soft, you will need to chill it.\nPreheat the oven to 375\u00b0F/190\u00b0C. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.\nDip the cookie stamps in a small bowl of flour, shake off any excess and then press them firmly into the dough, one at a time, to create a deep imprint. How far you need to press to get an imprint will depend on your stamp; the patterns on some are more deeply cut than others. Bear in mind that the cookies rise a little when cooked, so any soft imprints will disappear. Using a round cookie cutter that is slightly larger than the pattern, cut out the pieces of imprinted gingerbread. Transfer the cookies to the lined baking sheets, spaced about 3/4 inch/2 cm apart. Reroll the dough and continue to stamp and cut cookies until all the dough is used up.\nBake for 9\u201310 minutes, rotating the sheets halfway through, until firm to the touch. They will continue to firm up as they cool, so don\u2019t be tempted to bake them for any longer.\nTo make the rum butter glaze while the gingerbreads are in the oven, as the glaze needs to be brushed onto the cookies while they are still warm, sift the confectioners\u2019 sugar and cinnamon into a small bowl. Add the melted butter, rum (or lemon juice) and water and mix with a spoon until smooth. The glaze will thicken slightly if it sits around, so stir through a little more warm water if you need to\u2014it should be the consistency of runny honey.\nRemove the cookies from the oven, leave them to cool for 5 minutes, then brush or dab the glaze all over with a pastry brush. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.\nOnce the dough is made, it can be covered in plastic wrap and kept in the fridge for up to 2 days before baking.\nThese will keep for up to 5 days in an airtight container. The glaze will discolor and crack a little, but this will not affect how they taste.",

Steps:Sift flour (if using a cup measure, spoon into the cup and level with a knife before sifting).\nCombine butter, peanut butter, sugar, baking soda, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed to moisten, then increase to medium and cream until fluffy and light, about 5 minutes. Beat the whites with a fork until foamy and thin, then add to the butter and sugar in four additions, letting each incorporate before adding the next. Scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula, then resume mixing on low. Sprinkle in the flour, and mix to form a soft dough.\nKnead against the sides of the bowl to form a smooth ball, divide in half, and flatten into discs. Use immediately, or wrap in plastic and refrigerate for up to 1 week; soften for 30 minutes at room temperature, then knead on a bare work surface until pliable and smooth.\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350\u00b0F. On a flour-dusted surface, roll the dough until 1/2 inch thick. Sprinkle with flour, flip, sprinkle again, and roll just shy of 1/8 inch. Slide an offset spatula under the dough to loosen. Cut into \"peanuts\" with a 3-inch bikini cookie cutter (see Cooks' Note) or into simple 2 1/4-inch rounds and arrange on a parchment-lined aluminum baking sheet, leaving 1/4 inch between them. If you like, gently score the cutouts with a bench scraper to make a diamond pattern. Gather scraps, re-roll, and cut as before. The remaining scraps can also be baked, to grind for crumbs.\nBake until wafers are firm and dry, about 15 minutes. Cool completely on the baking sheet. Use immediately, or transfer to an airtight container and store for up to a week at room temperature or a month in the fridge.\nCombine butter, peanut butter, honey, vanilla, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed to moisten, then sprinkle in the powdered sugar a little at a time. Once fully incorporated, increase to medium and beat until the creme is soft and light, about 5 minutes, pausing to scrape the bowl and beater halfway through. Transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip.\nPipe 1/4 ounce (2 teaspoons) creme into the center of half of the rounds or 1/8 ounce (1 teaspoon) into each \"lobe\" of a peanut. Sandwich with the remaining wafers; there are extras to account for breakage. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate until the filling has set, about 15 minutes. Store up to 1 week at room temperature or up to a month in the fridge; serve at room temperature.\nCookie Crumbs: Grind broken wafers and scraps in a food processor until fine; freeze in a quart zip-top bag for up to 6 months. Use to replace the graham cracker crumbs in Souffl\u00e9ed Cheesecake or bake into a crumb crust.\nVegan: Replace the butter in the dough and filling with an equal amount of refined coconut oil and omit the egg whites in the dough. Refrigerate for 15 minutes before rolling the dough.\nGluten-Free: Replace the all-purpose flour with 4 ounces (1 1/4 cups) oat flour, 3 ounces (2/3 cup) white rice flour, and 2 ounces (1/2 cup) coconut flour.",

Be careful when you go to stir the polenta\u2014it tends to spit out pieces of the cornmeal, which is very hot. Remove the polenta from the heat and stir in the olive oil and basil. Drop in teaspoon-size pieces of the ricotta cheese. Pour the polenta into an 8-inch square baking pan and spread evenly. Sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese and let sit for 1 hour or until the polenta has firmed up. Bake the polenta in the oven for 15 minutes or until heated through. Cut the polenta into 8 equal pieces.\nPlace 1/2 cup warm tomato sauce in 4 shallow bowls and top with two pieces of the polenta. Sprinkle with the chopped basil.",

Ingredients:['3 tablespoons olive oil', '1 cup minced onion', '2 cups (1/2-inch) cauliflower florets', '1 cup chicken stock', '3 tablespoons unsalted butter', '2 tablespoons flour', '1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg', '1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper', '3/4 teaspoon salt', '1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper', '1 cup ricotta cheese', '1 cup grated fontina', '4 eggs, beaten', '4 cups arugula or watercress', '2 to 3 tablespoons Lemon\u2013Olive Oil Dressing']. Steps:Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F.\nHeat the olive oil in a medium saucepot with a lid over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the minced onion, and saut\u00b4\u00e9 until it is thoroughly soft, about 10 minutes. Transfer the onion to a mixing bowl to cool.\nCombine the cauliflower and the chicken stock in the pot you used to saut\u00e9 the onion (no need to clean it first). Raise the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Cover the pot, and boil until the florets are soft, about 10 minutes or so. Strain the cauliflower, reserving the stock. Add the florets to the onion, and mash them up a bit with a fork.\nUsing the same pot, melt the butter over low heat (no need to clean the pot first). Use a pastry brush to swirl some of the melted butter around the insides of the ramekins. Cut circles of parchment paper to fit the bottoms of the ramekins. Butter the circles, and set them in place. Set the ramekins aside.\nAdd the flour to the remaining butter in the pan, whisking with a fork as you add to prevent lumps. Add the reserved stock a little at a time, whisking as you pour. Raise the heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil. Simmer for about 5 minutes to thicken, whisking to prevent and break up any lumps. Add the stock mixture to the cauliflower and onions, and toss to coat. Add the nutmeg, cayenne, salt, and black pepper to the bowl, and stir, mixing thoroughly. Let cool for 5 minutes.\nOnce the cauliflower mixture has cooled a bit, fold in the cheeses. Add the eggs, and fold them in as well. Spoon the mixture into the ramekins. Pour a cup or so of hot water into a 9x13-inch casserole, and place the ramekins in the baking dish.\nBake until the sformati are set and the tops are browned, about 40 minutes. (If the water evaporates during baking, add more hot water.) Remove the ramekins from the casserole, and let sit until they are thoroughly cool. (Since they are served at room temperature, you can make the sformati well in advance.)\nWhen ready to serve, toss the salad greens with the lemon\u2013olive oil dressing. Unmold the sformati by running a thin knife around the edge of the ramekins. Place a small plate on top of each ramekin, and invert it, tapping lightly if necessary. The sformati should come out of the mold in one piece. Peel and discard the parchment. Serve, browned side up, with the greens on the side.",

Ingredients:['1 3/4 cups (7 ounces) graham cracker crumbs (store-bought, or make Whole Wheat Graham Crackers)', '2 tablespoons (1 ounce) unsalted butter, melted', '1/8 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized)', '2 pounds cream cheese (four 8-ounce packages), softened\u2014about 70\u00b0F', '1 cup (8 ounces) fresh goat cheese (not precrumbled), softened\u2014about 70\u00b0F', '1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice', '1 tablespoon vanilla extract', '1/4 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized)', '1/4 teaspoon orange flower water', '2 cups (14 ounces) sugar', '6 large eggs, straight from the fridge', '3/4 cup (6 ounces) heavy cream']. Steps:Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 450\u00b0F. This recipe requires an 8-by-3 3/4-inch round pan, whether springform, non-latching with a removable bottom, or a traditional cake pan. With a two-piece pan, wrap the bottom in foil before attaching the sides. With a solid pan, line the bottom with parchment paper. In either case, lightly grease the pan.\nAdd the crumbs, butter, and salt to the prepared pan, stir with a fork until well combined, and then compress into an even layer.\nCombine cream cheese, goat cheese, lemon juice, vanilla extract, salt, and orange flower water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed until roughly combined, then increase to medium and beat until smooth, about 5 minutes; halfway through, pause to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula.\nReduce speed to medium-low, add sugar all at once, and mix until well combined. Set a fine-mesh sieve over the bowl, crack in the eggs, and whisk until they pass through; discard any clots that remain. Resume mixing on low until well combined, then scrape the bowl and beater once more.\nIn a 1-quart stainless steel saucepan, bring the cream to a full boil. Add to batter while mixing on low; this helps release any air pockets introduced in mixing. Use immediately, or refrigerate until needed\u2014up to 1 week (bring to room temperature before baking).\nPour into the prepared pan and place on a baking sheet. Bake until the cheesecake puffs 1/2 inch over the rim of the pan and is golden on top, about 20 minutes. If necessary, rotate the baking sheet halfway through baking to ensure even browning.\nTurn off the oven and open the door to vent for 10 minutes. Close the door, set oven to 250\u00b0F, and continue baking until the outer edges of the cheesecake feel firm and the center registers 145\u00b0F on a digital thermometer, about 35 minutes.\nCool cheesecake for 15 minutes, then run a thin knife around the sides to loosen (this helps the cake settle evenly as it cools). Cool for an hour more, then cover and refrigerate until cold, at least 12 hours.\nLoosen the sides of the cheesecake with a thin knife. For a springform pan, simply pop the latch and remove the sides. For a non-latching pan, set on a large can of tomatoes or similarly sized object and use both hands to carefully drop the outer ring. For a solid cake pan, let stand in a few inches of scalding water until the pan feels warm. Drape the cake with plastic wrap and invert onto a large flat plate. Remove the pan or the bottom of a two-piece pan, peel off the parchment, and invert onto a serving plate.\nCut with a long thin knife, pausing to clean the blade under hot running water between slices. Tightly wrapped in plastic, leftovers will keep for up to 10 days in the fridge.\nCut with a long thin knife, pausing to clean the blade under hot running water between slices. Tightly wrapped in plastic, leftovers will keep for up to 10 days in the fridge.\nCookie Crumb Cheesecake: Replace the Graham Cracker crumbs with an equal amount of Oreo crumbs or Nutter Butter crumbs.\nFromage: For a truly cheesy cake, reduce the cream cheese to 24 ounces, omit the goat cheese, and divide the remaining 16 ounces between two or more of your favorite soft, rich cheeses. Some of my favorites include Fromage d\u2019Affinois, Saint-Marcellin, B\u00fbcheron, mascarpone, and even Saint Agur (a particularly creamy blue). Their flavor will shine through clearly, so choose something you know and love.\nGreen Tea Cheesecake: The herbal, mossy flavor of Japanese green tea provides a lovely counterpoint to the tangy richness of cream cheese. Simply whisk 2 tablespoons matcha (not bagged or loose green tea) into the sugar and proceed as directed.\nPumpkin Cheesecake: Reduce cream cheese to 1 1/2 pounds (3 cups), replace lemon juice with \u00bd ounce (1 tablespoon) dark rum, and increase kosher salt to 1/2 teaspoon. Along with sugar, add 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, 1\u00bd teaspoons ground ginger, and 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves. Omit heavy cream, and replace with 15 ounces (1 2/3 cups) pumpkin puree. If you like, serve with butterscotch sauce and a sprinkling of toasted hazelnut pieces.\nGluten-Free: Prepare crust with the Gluten-Free variation of my Crispy Whole Wheat Graham Crackers (TK LINK TO RECIPE); thanks to the roasted soybean flour in the dough, they bake up with a nutty richness much like classic whole wheat.",

        "content": "We will be making Crispy Whole Wheat Graham Crackers, here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['3/4 cup (5 1/2 ounces) sugar', '1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda', '1/2 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized)', '1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon', '1 tablespoon vanilla extract', '1/4 cup (3 ounces) golden syrup, such as Lyle\u2019s, sorghum, unsulfured molasses (not blackstrap), or honey', '1 1/2 sticks (6 ounces) unsalted butter, solid but creamy\u2014about 70\u00b0F', '2 1/2 cups (12 ounces) whole wheat flour (not stone-ground or white whole wheat)', 'plus more for dusting']. Steps:Combine sugar, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, vanilla, golden syrup, and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed to moisten, then increase to medium and beat until somewhat light, about 3 minutes. Reduce speed to low, add whole wheat flour, and mix to form a soft dough.\nScrape dough onto a work surface and knead gently to form a ball. Divide in half. Use immediately or wrap in plastic and refrigerate for up to 1 week; soften for 30 minutes at room temperature, then knead on a bare work surface until pliable and smooth.\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350\u00b0F. Generously flour a large sheet of parchment and place one portion of dough in the center. Pat into a 5-by-6-inch rectangle, sprinkle with flour, flip, and dust again. Working from the center out and adding more flour as needed, roll the dough until roughly 15-by-11 inches and very thin. Slide onto an aluminum baking sheet and brush away excess flour. Repeat with remaining dough.\nFor grocery store look-alikes, score each sheet of dough into twelve 2 1/4-by-4 3/4-inch rectangles and dock with a bamboo skewer or the narrow end of a chopstick (a strictly cosmetic procedure). Otherwise, leave the dough uncut.\nBake until crackers are tawny brown and firm, though your fingertip may leave a faint indentation, about 20 minutes. Immediately cut along the pre-scored lines with a knife, or cut into free-form shapes using a pizza wheel. Cool to room temperature directly on the baking sheets. Enjoy scrap pieces as a snack, or pulverize into crumbs. The grahams can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 weeks at room temperature or frozen for up to 3 months.\nChocolate: My mom used to sandwich chocolate graham crackers with peanut butter for an after-school snack, a combo I re-create by reducing the whole wheat flour to 10 ounces (21/4 cups), sifted with 1 ounce (1/3 cup) natural or Dutch-process cocoa powder. To retain their deep cocoa color, roll the dough in sifted cocoa powder. Serve with generous smears of peanut butter and a tall glass of milk.\nCinnamon Sugar: We rarely had sugar-coated grahams in our pantry when I was a kid, but they were always at my best friend\u2019s house, and seemed all the more special for their rarity. For the dough, increase the cinnamon to \u00bd teaspoon. Before docking, dust each sheet of dough with a half batch of Cinnamon Sugar (page 44), or any Sugar Sprinkle (page 46). Otherwise, dock and bake as directed. After the crackers cool, gently tap each against the baking sheet to knock off any excess sugar.\nCoconut (vegan): Replace the butter with 5 1/2 ounces (3/4 cup) virgin coconut oil (solid but creamy\u2014about 70\u00b0F) and add 1 teaspoon pure coconut extract along with the vanilla.\nGingerbread: This variation has all the spicy complexity of a Christmas cookie, with the unique flavor and crunch of a classic graham. Make the dough with sorghum or unsulfured molasses (not blackstrap) and increase the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon. Along with the sugar, add 1 tablespoon orange zest, 2 teaspoons ground ginger, 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves, and a few cracks of black pepper.\nGraham Cracker Crumb Crust: Combine 9 ounces (2 cups) finely ground graham cracker crumbs with 2 ounces (4 tablespoons) melted unsalted butter. Scatter into a 9-by-1 1/4-inch glass or ceramic pie plate and press into an even layer over the bottom and up the sides. Bake at 350\u00b0F until firm, about 18 minutes. Cool to room temperature for immediate use in your favorite recipe, or wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate for up to 1 week.\nGluten-Free: Replace the whole wheat flour with 6 ounces (11/4 cups) white rice flour, 4 ounces (1 cup plus 2 tablespoons) oat flour, and 1/2 ounce (1 tablespoon) kinako.",

Ingredients:['2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, divided, plus more for rolling', '1 1/4 teaspoon salt, divided', '1/3 cup plus 1 1/2 tablespoons granulated sugar, divided', '2 sticks (16 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces and frozen for 15 minutes', '1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar, chilled', '1 large egg', '1 tablespoon whole milk', '3 1/2 pounds Honeycrisp, Braeburn, or Golden Delicious apples, or a mix', '1 teaspoon ground cinnamon', '1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg', '2 tablespoons lemon juice', 'Coarse sugar, for sprinkling', '9-inch pie pan']. Steps:In the bowl of a food processor, pulse 2 1/2 cups flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar. Add butter and pulse until coarse, pea-sized crumbs appear, about 10 seconds. With the machine running, add vinegar and 1/4 cup ice water and process until the dough just holds together, about 30 seconds. Squeeze a small amount of dough between your fingers and if it is very crumbly, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time (2 tablespoons maximum). Do not over process.\nTurn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and push together into a rough ball. Knead a few times to combine, then divide into two equal balls. Flatten each ball into a disc with smooth edges (no cracks), cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 1 hour (or up to overnight).\nPreheat the oven to 425\u00b0F with one rack on the bottom rung and one rack in the center of oven. Place a rimmed baking sheet on the bottom rack to preheat.\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll out one disc of dough into a 13-inch round. Roll the dough loosely around the rolling pin, and then unfurl it into the 9-inch pie pan. Gently lift and settle the dough into the pan. Trim the excess dough using scissors, leaving a 1/2-inch overhang, and transfer to the refrigerator. On a floured piece of parchment, roll out the second disc of dough to the same size as the first and refrigerate both crusts for 30 minutes.\nIn a small bowl, whisk together the egg and milk and set aside. Peel, core, and slice the apples into 1/4-inch thick wedges. Place apples in a large bowl and mix with 1/4 cup flour, 1/3 cup sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and lemon. Fill the dough-lined pan with the apple mixture, packing apple slices as tightly as possible.\nBrush the rim with egg and milk mixture, reserving the excess. Top with the second dough round and press over apples to minimize excess space between apples and crust. Press the top and bottom crusts together and trim the top crust to a 1-inch edge around pan. Tuck top edge under bottom edge and crimp or decorate as desired. Cut five vents in the top crust for steam. Refrigerate pie for 30 minutes to set the crimp.\nBrush top crust with egg wash and sprinkle with coarse sugar.\nPlace pie on the preheated rimmed baking sheet and bake until the crust begins to turn golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Rotate sheet, move to center rack, and reduce oven to 350\u00b0F. Continue baking until the crust is golden brown and you can see the thickened juices bubbling, 40 to 50 minutes more. Cool on a rack 3 to 4 hours to allow juices to set before slicing.\nThe pie dough can be made up to 3 days in advance and chilled, or frozen for up to 3 months; thaw before using. The baked pie will keep, loosely covered with aluminum foil, at room temperature for up to 2 days.",

Steps:Finely grind peppercorns, juniper berries, and coriander seeds in spice mill or with mortar and pestle; transfer to a small bowl and mix in salt and sugar.\nSet blade on a box cutter to about 1/3\" (or use a very sharp paring knife or X-Acto knife) and cut long parallel lines into the skin of pork shoulder, spacing about 3/4\" apart. You want to cut completely through the fat, getting as close to the meat as possible without slicing into it. Then, using a pair of kitchen shears, snip between rows to create a diamond-shape pattern, spacing about 3/4\" apart. Cutting a crosshatch design into the fat will help it cook out and allow the salt and spices to penetrate the meat.\nRub entire shoulder with spice mixture, covering any exposed meat and pushing into cuts in fat. Try to get the spices into the fatty layer and not on the surface of the skin, where they may burn as the shoulder roasts. Make sure to use all of the spices, even though it may seem like a lot.

Steps:Place 5 Tbsp. butter in a medium bowl. Cook remaining 5 Tbsp. butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, swirling often, until butter foams, then turns golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in garlic; scrape butter mixture and all those toasty milk solids at the bottom of the pan into bowl with butter pieces. Reserve saucepan. Stir until all the butter is melted and mixture is smooth. Let sit, stirring occasionally, until butter is room temperature and solidified, 15\u201320 minutes.\nMeanwhile, whisk 1/4 cup milk, 3 Tbsp. flour, and 1/4 cup water in reserved saucepan until smooth, then set over medium heat and cook, whisking constantly, until it becomes a very stiff paste resembling mashed potatoes, about 2 minutes. Scrape into the bowl of a stand mixer; reserve saucepan.\nGently heat remaining 1/2 cup milk in reserved saucepan over low (it should be warm to the touch but not steaming hot). Remove from heat and let sit 1 minute. Add yeast and whisk until dissolved. Let mixture sit until foamy, about 5 minutes.\nMeanwhile, brush bottom and sides of a 13x9\" baking dish with 2 Tbsp. garlic butter; set aside. Set aside another 2 Tbsp. garlic butter in a small bowl for brushing over baked rolls.\nAdd yeast mixture, sugar, 1 egg, and remaining 2 1/4 cups flour to paste in mixer bowl. Using the dough hook, mix on low speed until a shaggy dough forms. Add kosher salt, increase speed to medium, and continue mixing until dough forms a smooth single mass, about 3 minutes. Reduce speed to low again and add remaining garlic butter a tablespoonful at a time, waiting until incorporated before adding more. Once all of the garlic butter has been added, increase mixer speed back to medium and mix dough until very soft, smooth, and supple, another 8\u201310 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl; form dough into a ball and place in bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm draft-free spot until doubled in size, 45\u201360 minutes.\nPunch down dough and knead several times to deflate, then turn out onto a clean work surface. To form the rolls, divide dough into 15 equal pieces (about 1 1/2 oz. each). Working one at a time and keeping other pieces covered in plastic, fold edges of dough underneath, pinching bottom to seal. Turn 90\u00b0 and fold and pinch again. Repeat process until you have created a smooth sphere with no seams except at the bottom.\nPlace ball on work surface and rest the side of your hand next to it so your palm and fingers are cupped around it. Drag the ball toward you, using friction against the work surface to create tension and stretch the surface of the dough into a smooth, taut dome. This shaping method tightens the gluten over the surface so the rolls rise evenly upward and outward instead of slumping into amorphous blobs. Repeat with remaining balls of dough and place in prepared pan in a 5x3 grid, spacing evenly apart.\nLoosely cover pan with plastic wrap and let rolls rise in a warm draft-free spot until doubled in size and touching, 35\u201345 minutes (to test, poke one with an oiled finger; dough should spring back but leave a slight indentation).\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 375\u00b0F. Beat remaining egg in another small bowl until yolks and whites are incorporated and no streaks remain. Gently brush tops of rolls with egg, then sprinkle with sea salt.\nBake rolls until they are deep golden brown, 20\u201325 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and brush warm rolls with reserved 2 Tbsp. garlic butter; let cool in pan 10 minutes.\nSlide an offset spatula around sides and underneath rolls to loosen, then invert onto rack and turn right side up. Let cool at least another 15 minutes before serving.\nDough can be formed into rolls (do not let rise) 1 day ahead; cover and chill. Let rise before baking; this may take around 3 hours.",

        "content": "We will be making Caramel Apple Drip Cake with Candied Walnuts, here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['1 cup raw walnuts', 'Nonstick vegetable oil spray', '2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour', '2 teaspoons baking powder', '1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt', '1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon', '3/4 teaspoon baking soda', '1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg', '3 medium apples (such as Gala, Honeycrisp, or Pink Lady), peeled, coarsely grated', '1 cup buttermilk, room temperature', '4 large eggs, room temperature', '1 cup granulated sugar', '3/4 cup (packed) dark brown sugar', '2 teaspoons vanilla extract', '3/4 cup vegetable oil', '1 cup granulated sugar, divided', '2 cups raw walnut halves', '2/3 cup granulated sugar', '1 tablespoon light corn syrup', '1/2 cup heavy cream', '1 tablespoon unsalted butter', '1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract', 'Pinch of kosher salt', 'Classic Cream Cheese Frosting', '2 (8\") round cake pans']. Steps:Position a rack in center of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0F. Spread walnuts in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet and toast until golden brown and aromatic, 5\u20138 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes.\nMeanwhile, lightly coat cake pans with nonstick spray. Line bottom of pans with parchment paper; lightly coat parchment with nonstick spray. Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, baking soda, and nutmeg in a medium bowl.\nPulse walnuts and 1/2 cup dry ingredients in a food processor until walnuts are chopped into a fine flour. Transfer chopped walnuts to bowl with remaining dry ingredients. Mix apples and buttermilk in another medium bowl.\nUsing an electric mixer on high speed, beat eggs, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl until pale and thick, about 4 minutes. Reduce mixer speed to medium-low and gradually stream in oil. Add dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with apple mixture in 2 additions, beginning and ending with dry ingredients; beat until smooth. Divide batter between prepared pans; smooth top.\nBake cakes, rotating pans halfway through, until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 40\u201345 minutes. Transfer pans to a wire rack and let cakes cool 10 minutes. Run a knife around sides of cakes and invert onto wire rack; remove parchment. Let cool completely.\nSpread granulated sugar in a thin layer in the center of a large dry skillet. Cook over medium heat, mostly undisturbed (it's okay to swirl pan gently to get sugar to melt evenly), until sugar is melted, about 10 minutes. Quickly stir in walnuts and cook, stirring, until coated and melted sugar is chestnut brown, about 1 minute more. Scrape onto a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and spread out to cool, separating walnut halves into individual pieces. Transfer half of nuts to a food processor and coarsely chop.\nBring granulated sugar, corn syrup, and 2 Tbsp. water to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Continue to cook, without stirring, until medium amber in color, about 6 minutes.\nMeanwhile, bring cream to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat or warm in microwave 45 seconds.\nRemove saucepan with sugar from heat and carefully whisk in cream, stirring from the center outward, until well combined. Stir in butter. Add vanilla and salt and stir to combine. Transfer caramel to a heatproof container and let cool until thickened.\nSpread 1 Tbsp. frosting in the center of a platter. Place 1 cake, domed side down, on platter. Spread 1 1/4 cups frosting evenly over top. Top with 1 cup chopped candied walnuts, reserving whole candied walnuts. Place remaining cake, domed side down, on top. Spread top and sides with 2 cups frosting. Chill 30 minutes to let frosting set.\nSpread remaining frosting over top and sides of cake. Chill at least 30 minutes or up to overnight to let frosting set.\nPlace a spoonful of caramel sauce on top of cake near one edge. Using the bottom of the spoon, spread it out, then very gently press a little sauce over the edge. Move spoon around perimeter of cake slightly and repeat to create additional drips, rotating cake as you work and spreading excess sauce across top of cake. When entire cake is covered in drips, add remaining sauce to fully cover top.\nChill at least 30 minutes to let glaze set. Decorate top and sides of cake with remaining whole walnuts and serve.\nCake can be made 3 days ahead; wrap tightly in plastic and chill, or freeze up to 2 weeks. Caramel can be made up to 2 weeks ahead; cover and chill.",

Ingredients:['4 cups/140 g store-bought tiny pretzel twists', '1/2 cup plus 3 tbsp/155 g unsalted butter, melted', '1/2 cup/50 g firmly packed light brown sugar', '1 1/2 cups/360 ml cold heavy (whipping) cream', '1/2 cup plus 2 tbsp/125 g granulated sugar', '2 tsp pure vanilla extract', 'One 8-oz/225-g package cream cheese', '3/4 cup/180 ml water', 'One 3-oz/85-g package strawberry gelatin', 'About 2 quarts/910 g large fresh strawberries', 'tops trimmed']. Steps:Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F/180\u00b0C/gas 4.\nPut the pretzels into a resealable plastic bag and crush them with a rolling pin into pieces that are no larger than 1/4 in/6 mm. (Or pulse the pretzels in a food processor, if you prefer.) Pour the crushed pretzels and their crumbs into a medium bowl and stir in the butter and brown sugar. Press the crust mixture into the bottom of a 9-in/23-cm springform pan, covering the bottom of the pan evenly. Bake the crust until it is lightly toasted, 10 to 12 minutes. It will be soft and puffy when you first remove it from the oven, but will harden as it cools. Set the crust aside to cool completely.\nPut the bowl of a stand mixer and the whip attachment in the freezer for 10 minutes.\nAttach the bowl and the whisk attachment to the mixer, and pour in the cream. Begin whipping the cream on medium speed. When it starts to thicken, pour in 2 tbsp of the granulated sugar and the vanilla. Whip the cream mixture on medium speed until soft peaks form. (When you dip a spoon into the whipped cream and pull it out, the cream should form a peak that curls back onto itself.) Set aside 1 1/2 cups/360 ml of the whipped cream in a small bowl. Transfer the remaining whipped cream to a separate bowl, cover, and refrigerate; you will use it to top the tart later.\nPut the remaining 1/2 cup/100 g of granulated sugar and the cream cheese in the bowl of the stand mixer. Using the paddle attachment, beat the sugar and cream cheese together on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Remove the bowl from the mixer, and stir the reserved 1 1/2 cups of whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture until it is homogenous. Spread the cream cheese filling evenly over the cooled crust. Be sure to completely cover the crust, spreading the filling to the edges of the pan. Use a damp paper towel to wipe down any specks of filling clinging to the sides of the pan or the edges of the tart will appear messy when the springform is removed. Refrigerate until chilled and set, 30 minutes.\nMeanwhile, bring 1/2 cup/120 ml of the water to a boil over high heat. Put the gelatin powder in a medium heat-proof bowl and pour in the boiling water. Stir until the gelatin is completely dissolved. Stir in the remaining 1/4 cup/60 ml of cold water. Allow the gelatin to cool to room temperature.\nWhile the gelatin cools, arrange the strawberries, cut-side down, over the cream cheese filling to cover the entire top of the tart. Start by lining the edge of the tart with a ring of strawberries and work your way to the center in a target pattern. The tips of the berries should be pointing straight up. Pour the gelatin over the strawberries and cream cheese layer, coating the tops of the strawberries in the gelatin as you pour. Refrigerate, covered, until the gelatin is completely set, at least 1 hour. (The tart can be refrigerated up to 1 day before serving.)\nRemove the sides of the pan and transfer the tart (still on the springform base) to a serving platter. Gently rewhisk the reserved whipped cream for 10 to 15 seconds and pile it in the center of the tart, if you wish or pass at the table. Slice and serve immediately.",

Punch down dough on an unfloured surface to deflate, then divide in half (an easy way to do this is to use a scale and divide by weight). Return one half to greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap while you work on the other piece.\nUsing a rolling pin, roll dough to a 13\" circle. Settle into prepared skillet and let dough relax into pan, just coming up and over the edge slightly. If it shrinks, stretch it by hand to create an even rim. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until increased in size by about 50%, 20\u201330 minutes.\nDivide second piece of dough into 3 equal pieces. Working with 1 piece at a time and keeping remaining pieces on a rimmed baking sheet covered with plastic, roll on an unfloured surface to form 1 (36\"-long) rope. Arrange rope in a U-shape with ends pointing away from you. Holding an end in each hand, cross ends, then fold them down toward you to create a pretzel shape about 11\" wide. Return to rimmed baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Roll remaining 2 pieces to form 2 more (36\"-long) ropes. Twist ropes tightly around each other to make a twisted rope about 35\" long. Add to baking sheet with pretzel shape and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise at room temperature until increased in size by about 50%, 20\u201330 minutes.\nIf dough has settled into skillet, stretch dough to come back up just to outside rim. Using a fork, evenly prick bottom of dough in pan. Brush dough all over with baking soda mixture, if using. Beat egg yolk with 1 Tbsp. water in a small bowl, then brush dough with egg wash. Cover only outer rim of dough with foil. Bake dough in skillet until light golden brown and dry, 12\u201315 minutes. Let cool slightly, at least 5 minutes.\nBrush just outside rim of crust with egg wash and attach twisted dough rope to create a decorative rim. Fill crust with apple mixture. Center pretzel shape over apple filling, stretching dough until edges of pretzel reach twisted outside rim. Brush twisted dough rope and top of pretzel shape with baking soda mixture, if using, then egg wash. Sprinkle with pretzel salt.\nBake pie until pretzel is golden brown and firm to the touch, 12\u201315 minutes. If underside of dough seems underbaked, loosely cover top with foil and continue to bake, checking every 2 minutes, until cooked through. Let cool completely before slicing, at least 2 hours.\nPretzel dough can be made 1 day ahead. Let come to room temperature, then let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours. Apple pie filling can be made 2 days ahead. Store in a resealable container and chill. Bring to room temperature before baking. Baking soda solution can be made 3 days ahead. Store in a resealable container at room temperature.",

Steps:Pulse sugar, salt, and 2 1/2 cups flour in a food processor to combine. Add butter and pulse until coarse, pea-sized crumbs form, about 10 seconds. With the motor running, add vinegar and 1/4 cup ice water and process until dough just comes together, about 30 seconds. Squeeze a small amount of dough between your fingertips; if it's very crumbly, add more ice water, 1 Tbsp. at a time (2 Tbsp. maximum). Do not overprocess.\nTurn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and form into a rough ball. Knead a few times to combine, then divide into 2 equal balls. Flatten each ball into a disc with smooth edges and no cracks. Cover with plastic wrap and chill at least 1 hour or up to overnight.\nPeel, core, and slice apples into 1/4\"-thick slices. Coarsely chop slices. Transfer to a large pot and add brown sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon, salt, 2 tsp. flour, and 2 Tbsp. water; stir to combine. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally and adding water 1 Tbsp. at a time if bottom starts to brown, until apples are softened but still have a little bite, about 10 minutes. Let cool to room temperature.\nPreheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Beat egg and milk in a small bowl.\nRoll 1 disc of dough to an 1/8\"-thick round about 13\" in diameter. Using 3\" cutter, cut dough into 12 rounds. Transfer rounds to prepared baking sheet. Spoon 1 heaping Tbsp. filling onto each round (do not overfill). Chill on sheet until ready to use.\nRoll second disc of dough to an 1/8\"-thick round about 13\" in diameter. Using 3\" cutter, cut into 12 more rounds. Using leaf-shaped cutter, cut a hole in center of each round.\nBrush edges of rounds with apple filling with egg wash. Place cut-out rounds over filled rounds to create sandwiches, then press down lightly around edges to seal completely. Gently press down in center to even out filling.\nBrush top of sandwiches with egg wash and sprinkle with demerara sugar, if using.\nBake cookies until golden brown and crisp on the bottom, 30\u201335 minutes. Let cool on baking sheet 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.\nCookies can be baked 2 days ahead. Loosely cover with foil and store at room temperature.

Steps:Season lamb generously with salt and pepper; let it sit out at room temperature while you prepare the rub.\nUsing spice mill or mortar and pestle, coarsely grind fennel seeds and red pepper flakes. Transfer to a small bowl and mix in garlic and 3 Tbsp. oil. Evenly rub lamb all over with spice mixture, making sure to work it into every nook and cranny.\nPreheat oven to 300\u00b0F.

As soon as oil is hot and shimmering, add lamb to skillet and cook, carefully pouring off fat as needed into a small bowl (reserve it), until golden brown all over, 3\u20135 minutes per side. The goal here is to cook out some of the excess fat while you brown the meat, so it\u2019s important to maintain a moderate heat to keep the meat from getting dark before the fat can melt out. If the oil looks really dark or tastes burned, discard it and use olive oil in the next step.\nTrim tops from carrots and set aside for making the salsa verde. Scrub carrots, pat dry, and scatter along the outer edges of a large rimmed baking sheet. Place seared lamb in the center. Pour reserved fat and any fat still in skillet (don\u2019t forget to scrape out the crispy bits stuck to the bottom of the pan) over carrots, season with salt and pepper, and toss to coat.\nRoast lamb and carrots until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of leg registers 135\u00b0F for medium-rare, 75\u201390 minutes. Transfer lamb to a cutting board and tent with foil; let rest 20 minutes. Leave oven on.\nWhile the lamb is resting, transfer carrots to a platter, then carefully pour any juices from the baking sheet into a small bowl (you should have about 1/4 cup; if you don\u2019t, top off with olive oil). Transfer carrots back to baking sheet and pop back into oven. Roast 5 minutes to reheat.\nMeanwhile, finely chop reserved carrot tops to make 1/2 cup; discard remaining tops. Place in a small bowl and mix in parsley, chives, lemon juice, pan juices, and 2 Tbsp. oil. Season with salt and pepper and more lemon juice if needed.\nRemove twine from lamb and slice about 1/2\" thick (but you can really go as thick or thin as you would like).

If you're nervous about leakage, you can wrap the Camembert in foil or line the basket with parchment paper as a layer of protection. Place the cheese in the wooden crate on a baking tray.\nWith a thin sharp knife, make gridlike cuts in the cheese, 3 or 4 in each direction, about 1 inch apart and going about 1 inch deep into the cheese but without cutting through the bottom rind. Use your knife tip to \"open\" each cut and your fingers to press a little sliver of garlic into each cut. Combine the olive oil with the thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper in a small dish. Spread thickly on top of the cheese.\nFor 15 to 20 minutes, until the cheese is loose inside the rind. Serve immediately with crackers.",

Ingredients:['2/3 cup honey', '2 (3\") cinnamon sticks', '1 1 /2 cups sugar, divided', '3 tablespoons bourbon', '3 cups raw pecans (about 12 ounces)', '1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon', '1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest, plus 1 teaspoon orange curls', '20 (17x12\") sheets fresh phyllo pastry or frozen, thawed', '1 cup (2 stick) unsalted butter, melted', 'A 9-inch springform pan']. Steps:Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Bring honey, cinnamon sticks, 1 cup sugar, and 1 cup water to a boil in medium heavy saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to medium and continue to boil until syrup is reduced to about 1 1/2 cups, 15\u201318 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl, stir in bourbon, and let cool.\nMeanwhile, spread pecans on large rimmed baking sheet and toast until golden brown, 13\u201315 minutes. Let cool. Transfer nuts to a food processor. Add ground cinnamon, 1 tsp. orange zest, and remaining 1/2 cup sugar and pulse until coarsely chopped.\nPlace stack of phyllo sheets on a work surface. Keep any phyllo you're not currently working with covered under a layer of plastic wrap topped with a slightly damp kitchen towel. Using base of springform pan as a guide, and starting at edge of phyllo, carefully cut out 20 (9\") circles, leaving as much phyllo remaining as possible. Cover phyllo circles. Using base of pan as a guide, cut remaining phyllo into 20 (4 1/2\") half-circles.\nInsert base into pan and secure the latch. Brush base with butter. Place 1 phyllo circle in pan and brush generously with butter. Top with 2 half-circles to create a full circle, brush with butter. Top with full circle, brush again. Top with 2 more half-circles at a 90\u00b0 angle from the first half-circle layer, brush with butter. Top with a full circle, and brush again. You should have 5 layers of pastry (full circle - half-circles - full circle - half circles - full circle), with butter spread between each layer. Spread one-fifth of nut mixture over phyllo. Repeat layering 4 more times. Top with the 5 remaining phyllo circles; brush top with butter.\nUsing a sharp knife, score the top layer (do not cut through to bottom of pan) to divide into 4 quadrants. Working with 1 quadrant at a time, make 1 straight cut to divide the quadrant into 2 even wedges. Make 4 more straight cuts (2 each on either side of, and parallel to the quadrant division line), spacing evenly apart. Now working within each wedge, make 2 evenly-spaced cuts parallel to the outside edge of the quadrant, connecting at points with the previous cuts to form a diamond pattern. Repeat with the remaining quadrants to create a starburst pattern. Transfer pan to a rimmed baking sheet and bake until phyllo is golden brown, about 45 minutes.\nSpoon cooled syrup over hot baklava in 4 additions. Place orange curls on top. Let cool completely in pan. Remove springform ring and cut baklava along the scored lines.\nSyrup can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Baklava can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and store at room temperature.",

        "content": "We will be making Traditional Soft Pretzels, here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['1 (1/4-oz/7-g) package active dry yeast (2 1/4 tsp)', '1/2 cup/120 ml warm water (between 100 and 115\u00b0F/38 and 45\u00b0C)', '1 tbsp barley malt syrup or 1 tbsp firmly packed dark brown sugar', '3 1/4 cups/420 g unbleached bread flour', '1/2 cup/120 ml cold pilsner-style beer', '2 tbsp unsalted butter, cubed, at room temperature, plus more for greasing the bowl', '2 tsp fine sea salt, such as fleur de sel or sel gris', '2 tbsp food-grade lye', 'or 1/4 cup/60 g baked baking soda (see separate notes)']. Steps:Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water in the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl. Add the barley malt syrup, stirring until it is dissolved. Allow the yeast to bloom until it is foamy, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the flour, beer, butter, and salt and continue stirring to form a shaggy mass. Attach the bowl and the dough hook to the stand mixer and begin kneading on medium-low speed. After about 1 minute the dough will form a smooth ball. The dough should be quite firm and may be slightly tacky, but not sticky. (If it is sticky, add a little more flour, about 1 tbsp at a time, and knead it in until the dough is smooth. If the dough is too dry to come together, add more water, 1 tsp at a time.) Continue kneading the dough on medium-low speed until it is elastic, 5 to 7 minutes. Alternatively, turn the shaggy dough out onto an unfloured work surface and knead it by hand.\nChoose a bowl that will be large enough to contain the dough after it has doubled in size, and grease it lightly with butter. Transfer the dough to the greased bowl and cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Put the dough in the refrigerator to rise for at least 8 hours, and up to 24 hours, for optimal flavor.\nFor quick pretzels, allow the dough to rise at room temperature (in a warm spot) until it has doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.\nLine two 12-by-17-in/30.5-by-43-cm rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside.\nTurn the dough out onto an unfloured work surface and firmly press it down to deflate. To form the classic pretzel shape, cut the dough into eight equal portions. Work with one piece of dough at a time and keep the rest covered with a damp, clean kitchen towel. Pat a piece of dough down with your fingertips to form a rough rectangle about 3 1/2 by 5 1/2 in/9 by 14 cm. Beginning on a long side, roll the dough up tightly, forming it into a little loaf. Pinch the seam together. Shape the dough into a rope by rolling it against the work surface with your palms and applying mild pressure, working from the center of the dough out to the ends. If you need more friction, spray the counter with a little water from a squirt bottle or drizzle a few drops of water and spread it with your hand. Once you can feel that the dough rope doesn\u2019t want to stretch any farther (usually when it is between 12 to 16 in/30.5 to 40.5 cm long), set it aside to rest and begin shaping another piece in the same manner. Repeat this process with the remaining pieces of dough.\nReturn to the first dough rope and continue rolling it out to a length of 24 to 28 in/61 to 71 cm, leaving the center about 1 in/2.5 cm in diameter and tapering the ends thinly by applying a little more pressure as you work your way out. Position the dough rope into a U shape, with the ends pointing away from you. Holding an end in each hand, cross the ends about 3 in/7.5 cm from the tips and then cross them again. Fold the ends down and press them into the U at about 4 and 8 o\u2019clock, allowing about 1/4 in/6 mm of the ends to overhang. Place the pretzel on one of the prepared baking sheets and cover it with a damp towel. Repeat this process with the remaining dough, spacing out the pretzels on the baking sheets at least 1 in/2.5 cm apart and covering them with a damp towel.\nAllow the covered pretzels to rise at warm room temperature until they have increased in size by about half, 20 to 30 minutes. (The pretzels can be refrigerated at this point, covered tightly with plastic wrap, for up to 8 hours before dipping and baking them.)\nAt least 20 minutes before baking, position one rack in the upper third and another rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat it to 500\u00b0F/260\u00b0C/gas 10.\nPrepare the lye solution or baked baking soda solution.\nUse a large skimmer to gently dip the pretzels in the lye or baked baking soda solution, one or two at a time. Leave them in the solution for about 20 seconds, carefully turning once after 10 seconds. Remove the pretzels from the liquid, drain, and return them to the baking sheets, spacing them at least 1 in/2.5 cm apart. If the ends come detached, simply reposition them. Repeat with the remaining pretzels.\nUse a sharp paring knife or razor blade to cut a slit about 1/4 in/6 mm deep in the thickest part of each pretzel (the bottom of the U). Top them as you choose, if desired. Bake the pretzels until they are deep mahogany in color, 8 to 12 minutes, rotating the pans from front to back and top to bottom halfway through the baking time. Transfer the pretzels to a rack to cool for 10 minutes before serving. The pretzels are best enjoyed the day they are made, ideally warm from the oven or within an hour of being baked.\nTo store the pretzels, allow them to cool completely and then wrap each one individually in plastic wrap. Store them at room temperature for up to 2 days, or put the plastic-wrapped pretzels in a resealable plastic freezer bag and freeze them for up to 1 month. Reheat the pretzels in a 350\u00b0F/180\u00b0C/gas 4 oven for about 5 minutes, or for 10 to 12 minutes if frozen.",

Ingredients:['1/2 cup (4 ounces) sugar', '1/8 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized)', '1 1/2 cups (12 ounces) heavy cream', '2 teaspoons vanilla extract or 1 vanilla bean', 'split lengthwise with a paring knife']. Steps:Combine sugar, salt, cream, and vanilla extract, if using, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. If using a vanilla bean, run the flat of the blade down each half to scrape out the seeds and add them to the cream (reserve the pod for another project). Mix on medium-low speed to dissolve the sugar, about a minute, then increase to medium-high and whip until cream is thick enough to hold firm peaks, about 3 minutes.\nUse immediately, or cover and refrigerate until needed, up to 8 hours.\nRefrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to 1 week; before serving, briefly rewhip the cream to restore its light and silky texture.\nBasil: This emerald-green variation has an herbal freshness that's perfect with strawberry shortcake. Grind the sugar with 2 ounces (2 cups loosely packed) fresh basil leaves in a food processor until the leaves disappear and the sugar looks wet, like pesto. Proceed as directed.\nCherry Pit: A light cherry-almond flavor thats perfect with a slice of cherry pie. Combine heavy cream with 3 3/4 ounces (1/3 cup) cherry pits, cover, and steep overnight in the fridge. Strain and whip as directed.\nCocoa: Combine the sugar with 1 ounce (1/3 cup) Dutch-process cocoa powder, such as Cacao Barry Extra Brute.\nFreeze-Dried Fruit: This variation is as colorful as it is tasty. Grind sugar with 1/3 ounce (1/3 cup) freeze-dried fruit such as bananas, blueberries, cherries, or cranberries in a food processor until powdery and fine, then whip as directed. For a thicker consistency, pulse in the food processor bowl until thick, just 90 seconds or so.\nOrange: Combine sugar with 1 tablespoon orange zest and 1/4 teaspoon orange flower water.\nStrawberry: Double strawberry shortcake, anyone? Add 2 ounces (1/4 cup) chilled strawberry syrup to the cream and proceed as directed.",

        "content": "We will be making Quick Condensed Milk, here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['4 cups (32 ounces) milk (any percentage will do)', '3/4 cup (6 ounces) heavy cream', '1 cup (7 ounces) sugar', '1/8 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized)']. Steps:Combine milk, cream, sugar, and salt in a 5-quart stainless steel saucier. If using a scale, weigh the pot and ingredients together so you can digitally track the reduction. Place over medium heat, stirring occasionally with a heat resistant spatula, until the milk begins to simmer, about 12 minutes. Continue cooking another 30 minutes more, scraping continuously to prevent a milky buildup from forming around the sides. When the thickened milk-syrup suddenly begins to foam, it\u2019s almost done. Keep simmering and stirring until the foam subsides and the dairy has condensed to exactly 2 cups or 19 ounces. If using a scale, the pot will weigh 26 ounces less than when you started.\nPour into an airtight container, seal to prevent evaporation, and refrigerate up to 1 month. To mimic the consistency of canned milk, bring to room temperature before using.\nEven slightly acidic ingredients will cause hot dairy to curdle, including raw cane sugar, brown sugar, coconut sugar, maple syrup, honey, and agave. Take care when experimenting with ingredients not listed in the variations.\nChai Spice: Along with the sugar, add two 4-inch cinnamon sticks, 1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds, 1/2 teaspoon whole allspice berries, 10 whole black peppercorns, 5 whole cloves, and 6 white cardamom pods, gently cracked. Proceed as directed. For an easy chai latte, stir 1 tablespoon of the spiced milk into 6 ounces (3/4 cup) hot black tea, such as Assam.\nDulce de Leche: This rich and nutty variation owes its caramel flavor and color to baking soda, which raises the dairy\u2019s pH, allowing the lactose to brown at lower temperatures than normal. Add 1/2 teaspoon baking soda to the sugar and proceed as directed; though the mixture will foam more vigorously, there is no risk of overflow. Made with goat\u2019s milk in the variation below, dulce de leche is known as cajeta. As the browning process will resume with continued exposure to heat, neither dulce de leche or cajeta can be used as an ingredient in baked goods.\nFresh Ginger: Peel and roughly chop a 2-inch piece of fresh ginger; add along with the sugar.\nGoat's-Milk: This variation is more easily digested by those with lactose intolerance, and because goat\u2019s milk won\u2019t curdle when it\u2019s boiled, there\u2019s no need for cream. Trust me, there\u2019s nothing \u201cgoaty\u201d about it\u2014just gentle creaminess anyone can enjoy. Replace milk and cream with 38 ounces (4 3/4 cups) goat\u2019s milk and proceed as directed. Note: This variation requires \u201cultra-high temperature\u201d pasteurized goat\u2019s milk, as raw or low-heat pasteurized versions may turn grainy with prolonged cooking.\nLavender: During the cooking process, lavender mellows into something soft and aromatic, without any hint of the soapiness that can so often be its downfall. Add 1 tablespoon dried lavender buds along with the sugar.\nRosemary: Wonderfully herbaceous, this variation is my absolute favorite way to make Pumpkin Pie. Add a 4-inch sprig of fresh rosemary along with the sugar.\nSoft-Serve: This eggless ice cream has an unbelievably pure and creamy flavor, with a silkiness that reminds me of Dairy Queen soft serve. Prepare the Quick Condensed Milk or any variation and pour into a large bowl. Add 10 ounces (1 1/4 cups) heavy cream, 2 ounces (1/4 cup) whole milk, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt (half as much if iodized), and 1 tablespoon vanilla extract and mix well. Chill until cold, about 2 hours, and churn according to manufacturer directions.\nVanilla Bean: I make this variation whenever I have an empty vanilla bean left over from another project, as the cooking process will extract considerable flavor from even the most withered pod (the sheer volume of seeds in a \u201cfresh\u201d pod can turn the milk gray). Add scraped vanilla pod to the milk and proceed as directed. To deepen the flavor, leave the vanilla pod in the jar of Quick Condensed Milk.",

Ingredients:['1 3/4 cups plus 1 tablespoon | 8 ounces all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal, plus more for dusting', '1 tablespoon (1/2 ounce) sugar', '1 1/2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized)', '2 sticks (8 ounces) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes', '1/2 cup (4 ounces) cold water']. Steps:Sift flour into a medium bowl (if using cup measures, spoon into the cups and level with a knife before sifting). Whisk in sugar and salt. Cut butter into 1/2-inch cubes, no smaller, and toss with flour to break up the pieces. Roughly smash each cube flat\u2014nothing more! Stir in cold water and knead until the dough comes together in a ball. With a dough temperature at or below 70\u00b0F, it will feel dry to the touch.\nTransfer to a generously floured work space, sprinkle with more flour, and roll into a 10-by-15-inch sheet. Fold each 10-inch side toward the middle, and close the packet like a book. Fold top to bottom to make a thick block, then cut in half. Using as much flour as needed, roll one portion into a 14-inch round. Brush off excess flour, drape over a 9-inch tempered glass pie plate, making sure it\u2019s flush against the pan.\nTrim excess dough into a 1 1/4-inch overhang all around, then fold over to create a 3/4-inch border that sits on the rim of the plate; if positioned inside the rim, the crust will be too shallow to accommodate the filling. Pinch or press the border into a zigzag pattern, and repeat with remaining dough. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate at least 2 hours, or overnight. Alternately, formed crusts can be frozen up to 3 months and thawed in a refrigerator before use.\nAdjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350\u00b0F. Line the chilled crust with a large strip of foil (not parchment or wax paper), letting the excess loosely cover the rim. Fill with plain white sugar, a delicious alternative to options like rice or beans.\nBake on an aluminum baking sheet until fully set and golden brown, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and carefully lift out the foil, setting it aside until the sugar has cooled. If the sides of the crust seem puffy or pale, continue baking 10 minutes more. Cool to room temperature. Use immediately, or wrap in plastic and store at room temperature for up to 24 hours.\nIf the temperature climbs above 73\u00b0F in your kitchen, be aware that everything from your countertop to your rolling pin and the flour itself will act as a heat source to the butter. Combat these conditions by refrigerating your pie plate, rolling pin, and dry ingredients until cool\u2014not cold or frozen. If needed, chill the countertops of a sweltering hot kitchen with bags of ice water.\nGluten-Free: Replace the all-purpose flour with 4 ounces (3/4 cup) white rice flour, 2 1/2 ounces (1/2 cup) cornstarch, 1 1/2 ounces (1/3 cup) tapioca flour, 1 ounce (1/4 cup) coconut flour, and 1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum. Prepare the dough as directed, using a generous amount of cornstarch for dusting. The dough will crack along the creases as it\u2019s folded, but that\u2019s all right. After portioning the dough, roll to just 12 inches. Cut into quarters and transfer to the pie plate one at a time, pressing the pieces together and then sculpting the border like clay. Chill and bake as directed.",

Steps:Determine how much salt you need for your bird: Figure about 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal kosher salt per pound of turkey, or 2/3 tsp. Morton kosher salt per pound of turkey. For example, for a 12-pound turkey, use 1/4 cup Diamond Crystal kosher salt, or 2 Tbsp. plus 2 tsp. Morton kosher salt.\nWhisk salt, mustard powder, paprika, thyme, pepper, garlic powder, brown sugar, and onion powder in a small bowl.\nPlace turkey, breast side down, on a large cutting board. Cut along each side of backbone with kitchen shears\u2014this will take some force (you can ask your butcher to do this). Discard backbone or reserve for another use (like stock for gravy).\nWith turkey skin side down, use a knife to score long oblong bone in center of breast all the way down. Turn turkey skin side up, then firmly press down with both hands on breastbone until you hear a cracking sound. The bone should be cracked completely in half; if not, use your knife to cut the bone the rest of the way in half.\nPat turkey very dry with paper towels. Rub spice mixture all over skin and flesh sides. Splay open, skin side up, on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Tuck wing tips under breasts. Chill, uncovered, at least 1 day, preferably 2, and up to 3. If you\u2019d rather cover the bird, loosely cover with plastic wrap, then uncover for the final 4\u20136 hours of chilling. Do not rinse turkey after brining. Let sit at room temperature 1 hour before cooking.\nPrepare a grill for medium heat (if your grill has a thermometer, it should register about 350\u00b0F). Wrap bricks or cinder block in foil.\nOil grates well and transfer turkey, skin side down, onto grill. Wearing heatproof gloves, arrange bricks on top of turkey, with 3 across breast and 1 across drumsticks, or place cinder block in the center. Cover grill and cook, checking every 5 minutes, until skin side is deep golden brown and crispy, 10\u201315 minutes total.\nWearing heatproof gloves, carefully remove bricks or cinder block and flip bird over, skin side up. Cover grill and continue to cook until an instant-read thermometer registers 160\u00b0F (take temperature in a few places including thickest part of thigh and breast), 65\u201380 minutes more, replenishing coals if needed. Transfer turkey to cutting board, tent with foil, and let rest at least 30 minutes before carving.\nTurkey can be seasoned with dry brine ideally 2 days but up to 3 days ahead. Keep chilled.",

Ingredients:['1 cup water', '2 cups sugar', '2 tablespoons corn syrup', '1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar', '5 egg yolks', '1 whole egg', '1/8 teaspoon xanthan gum', '1 1/2 pounds cold butter', 'preferably European']. Steps:In a heavy nonreactive saucepan, add water, then add sugar, corn syrup, and cream of tartar. The last 2 help keep the sugar from crystallizing. (Candy thermometer. Non-negotiable!)\nPut the pot on high heat. It's going to be there for a while. Be patient and keep your eye on it. Don't go walking away and watching TV or something.\nPut yolks and eggs in a stand mixer with the whisk attachment and turn to high. Just let it go! Eggs will triple in volume and go to \"ribbons stage.\" You can't overwhip!\nWait on the sugar\u2014looking for 230\u00b0F, aka \"soft ball.\" When it happens, be ready to move quickly. Turn off the mixer and add the xanthan gum, turn back up to medium.\nRemove the thermometer from hot sugar. Lift with two hands. Rest the lip of the saucepan on the edge of the mixer bowl.\nSlowly tilt and pour sugar in a sloooow steady stream down the side of the bowl. Don't go too fast! If you do there will be chunks of scrambled eggs in your buttercream.\nOnce sugar is all in, turn the mixer to high. Beat until cool. Gauge this by putting the inside of your wrist to the outside of the bowl. It's more accurate than your hands. Switch out the whisk for the paddle. Next we're adding the butter. It's too heavy for the whisk and you'll end up breaking your stand mixer if you stay with the whisk.\nStart cutting the butter into thin pieces\u2014you could shave it with a cheese slicer if you'd like. Add butter piece by piece\u2014pain in the derriere, yes, but we're making an emulsion.\nSee, if you dump all the butter in at once, the butter and eggs will never combine properly, and you'll have a \"broken\" buttercream. You'll be able to identify this easily\u2014it'll be a chunky, watery, hot mess.\nIf your buttercream does break, you can fix it! Turn to medium high, then add a little more butter, piece by piece, until fixed. Or try adding a little guar gum! This is very strong, so add a pinch and beat for a minute, then check.\nOnce your butter is added, turn the mixer to medium high to add some air\u201410, 20 seconds at most. Quelle Magnifique! It should be fluffy and make you want to eat it with your fingers.\nOnce you have your base, there's so many ways to flavor it! Coffee powder! Vanilla beans! Dutch cocoa! Peanut butter! Caramel! Ham! Ok, maybe not ham. Party pooper.\nCongratulations! You did it! You made French buttercream! You are a god amongst men!\nFin",

        "content": "We will be making Detroit-Style Pizza, here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['1 cup (230g) Water, 100\u00b0F [38\u00b0C]', '1 tsp sea salt', '2 cups plus 1 Tbsp (290g) all-purpose flour', '3/4 tsp instant yeast', '1 (28-oz/795g) can crushed tomatoes', '3 Tbsp (44g) granulated sugar', '1 tsp dried oregano, crushed', '1 Tbsp dried basil, crushed', '1 1/2 tsp finely minced garlic', '1 tsp sea salt', '1/2 tsp ground black pepper', '1/4 cup (45g) shredded Parmesan cheese', '8 slices pepperoni (optional)', '2 cups (230g) shredded mozzarella cheese', '2 cups (230g) shredded brick cheese (or mozzarella)', '1 pinch dried oregano', '1 pinch sea salt', '1 cup (230g) pizza sauce', 'warm']. Steps:In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the water and sea salt and stir to dissolve the salt. Add the flour and yeast and mix with a wooden spoon until the dough becomes a shaggy mass. Make sure that all of the flour is hydrated. Using the dough hook attachment, mix on medium-low speed for 4 minutes. Scrape the sides of the bowl and release the dough from the hook. Mix for an additional 4 minutes. It will now hold a round shape.\nSpray a bowl with nonstick cooking spray or brush lightly with olive oil. Place the dough into the bowl and cover with plastic. Let the dough relax for 15 minutes, and then shape the dough.\nLightly oil or butter the inside surfaces of a 9-by-13-in [23-by-33-cm] baking pan or Detroit pizza pan.\nPlace the dough into the pan and use your fingertips to spread the dough out to the corners and sides of the pan. The dough will be sticky, so lightly dip your fingertips in oil to make stretching it easier. Set the pan aside, cover with plastic, and let rise in a warm area for1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until the dough is approximately 1/2 to 3/4 in [1.5 to 2 cm] tall in the pan.\nCombine the tomatoes, sugar, oregano, basil, garlic, salt, and pepper and stir together in a medium saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring periodically. Using an immersion blender or food processor, pur\u00e9e the sauce until smooth. Place it back over medium heat. Simmer the pur\u00e9ed sauce until slightly thickened, 5 to 10 minutes, stirring periodically.\nKeep the sauce warm for ladling over the pizza, or cool and refrigerate for up to a week. This recipe makes about 3 cups [710 ml] of sauce and it can also be frozen for up to 3 months, if desired. You will have more sauce than you need for one pizza.\nPreheat the oven to 475\u00b0F [240\u00b0C].\nSprinkle the Parmesan cheese around the edge of the pizza where the dough touches the sides of the pan. This cheese will form a crispy, caramelized edge on the crust. If desired, place pepperoni in two rows of four down the length of the pizza, directly on top of the dough. Gently push the pepperoni into the dough.\nSprinkle the mozzarella and brick cheeses over the surface of the pizza, spreading them all the way to the edges where the dough meets the sides of the pan. This cheese will also contribute to the crispy, caramelized edge on the crust. Season the top of the pizza with a pinch each of oregano and salt.\nPlace in the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Look for an amber-colored top and crispy edges.\nAfter removing the pizza from the oven, use a small offset spatula or knife to loosen the sides of the crust from the pan. Slide the pizza out of the pan onto a cooling rack. At this point, if a crispier bottom is desired, you can put the pizza (out of the pan) directly onto the oven rack or a sheet tray and bake for an extra 5 minutes for a slightly more browned finish on the bottom of the crust.\nAfter you remove the pizza from the oven, top it with the warm sauce. Traditionally, it is ladled into two rows down the length of the pizza. Serve warm.\nThis pizza can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 3 days and reheated on a lightly oiled sheet tray at 475\u00b0F [240\u00b0C].",

Ingredients:['623 g (5 cups plus 3 tablespoons) bread flour', '99 g (1/2 cup) granulated sugar', '12 g (1 tablespoon) fine sea salt', '10 g (1 tablespoon) instant yeast', '283 g (5 large) cold eggs, lightly whisked', '242 g (1 cup) whole milk', '397 g (14 oz) unsalted butter, at room temperature', '28 g (1 oz / 2 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature', '1 recipe Brioche Dough, cold', '1.13 kg (about 6 medium) Honeycrisp apples (or another good baking apple)', '106 g (1/2 cup packed) light brown sugar', '2 g (1 teaspoon) ground cinnamon', 'Flaky sea salt', 'for sprinkling']. Steps:In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, mix the flour, granulated sugar, and salt on low speed to combine. Add the yeast and mix to combine, 10 to 15 seconds more. Add the eggs and milk and mix for 4 minutes. The dough should form a sticky, shaggy ball around the hook.\nIncrease the speed to medium and slowly add the butter 1 tablespoon at a time, being careful to incorporate each addition before adding the next; the entire process should take about 3 minutes. (If you add the butter too quickly, it can create a greasy disaster in the bowl, so pace it out.) Scrape the bowl down once or twice to make sure everything is homogeneous. (This mixing period is called intense mixing\u2014and it is! Don\u2019t be alarmed if the mixing is noisy or difficult in the early to mid-stages, it will come together.) Then knead the dough until it is smooth and uniform, 1 minute more.\nGrease a large bowl with nonstick spray. Transfer the dough to the bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 12 hours.\nUse the butter to generously grease an 18-by-13-inch baking sheet, including the rim.\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to a 1/2-inch-thick rectangle a little larger than the pan (about 1 inch on all sides), so that the dough will come up the sides of the pan.\nRoll up the dough around the rolling pin and transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet. Use a pastry wheel to trim the edges so they are flush with the edges of the pan. Cover the baking sheet with greased plastic wrap (I use nonstick spray) and let the dough rise in a warm place for 30 to 35 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 350\u00b0F / 175\u00b0C, with a rack in the middle.\nMeanwhile, peel, quarter, and core the apples, then slice crosswise 1/8- to 1/4-inch thick (see Pro Tip).\nIn a small bowl, whisk together the brown sugar and cinnamon. Uncover the dough and sprinkle it evenly with half the cinnamon sugar. Arrange the apple slices across the dough (see Pro Tip). Sprinkle the remaining cinnamon sugar evenly over the apples. Finish with the salt.\nBake the tart until the edges of the crust are golden brown, the apples are tender when pierced with the tip of a paring knife, and the sugar has caramelized, 32 to 36 minutes. Cool the tart for at least 15 minutes before slicing and serving, warm or at room temperature.\nThis tart is best the same day it's made. Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.",

Add egg yolks and egg one at a time, beating well between each addition. With the motor running, gradually add sugar and salt and beat until filling is creamy and smooth, about 2 minutes. Add almond extract, vanilla extract, lemon zest, and orange zest and mix just to incorporate.\nSet pan with prepared crust on a large sheet of foil and fold up foil tightly around sides of pan (you can turn 2 small sheets of foil into 1 large sheet by folding their edges together several times, then opening up like a book). Repeat with several more pieces of foil to create a waterproof seal around the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Set inside a large roasting pan or baking dish and pour filling into crust (it will go above the crust).\nSet roasting pan on oven rack and carefully pour in very hot water to come about halfway up the side of the springform pan. Bake ricotta pie until the top is set and dry to touch but the filling still wobbles underneath (it will firm as it cools), 65\u201375 minutes. Transfer to the refrigerator and chill until cool and firm, 3\u20134 hours.\nSlice ricotta pie and serve topped with amarena cherries.\nCrust can be baked 1 day ahead. Store tightly covered at room temperature. Ricotta pie can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled.",

Transfer the pan to a wire rack and cool completely before frosting with orange frosting.\nButter two 9-inch round cake pans, line the bottoms with parchment paper cut to fit, and butter the parchment. Flour the pans, coating the bottom and sides of each pan, then tap out the excess flour. Divide the batter between the two pans and bake until the tops are dry to the touch, the sides of the cake start to pull away from the pan, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (for generally the same amount of time as in the cupcake recipe). Let cool on a wire rack, then remove each cake from its pan, discard the parchment paper, and set one cake layer on a cake round, frosting turntable, or the final serving platter. Frost the top of that cake layer with the frosting, stack the second layer on top, and frost the top and sides with the remaining frosting.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and salt on medium speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce the speed to low, gradually add the confectioners\u2019 sugar, and beat until incorporated. Increase the speed to medium, add the milk, orange zest and juice, and vanilla and beat until fully blended, 1 to 2 minutes, making sure not to incorporate too much air into the frosting.",

Place each ball on a large plate and squish it down into a flat patty. Press your thumb into the center to create a little well. This will help the burgers keep their flat shape.Spray the grill with olive oil and heat it to medium heat. Grill the patties on direct heat for 5 minutes, covered and undisturbed. Flip once, cover, and grill for another 4 to 6 minutes, until cooked through.To assemble the burgers, smear the caramelized onions on the bottom half of each roll or bun. Top with romaine and place a cooked patty on each. Add avocado slices and jalape\u00f1o rings, if using. Smear the top halves of the buns with Salsa Ranch Dip, then place them on the burgers and serve.",

Steps:Cut the chicken breasts into 1-inch pieces. Season with salt and pepper.\nMelt the butter in a very large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken, in batches if necessary, and saut\u00e9 until nicely browned on the outside, but still a bit pink inside, about 4 minutes (the pieces don\u2019t have to be browned on all sides; two sides is fine). Remove the chicken and set aside on a plate.\nDo not clean the pan! Those brown bits on the bottom of the pan are going to add flavor to the sauce. Add the garlic to the pan and saut\u00e9 over medium heat until you can smell it, 30 seconds. Turn the heat to high, add the chicken broth, and scrape the bottom of the pan to loosen up all of those delicious caramelized bits. Bring to a simmer, lower to medium heat, and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the pasta, stir well, and simmer until the pasta starts to soften, about 8 minutes. Stir in the warm cream and the browned chicken with any juices that have accumulated on the plate. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is tender, most of the liquid has been absorbed, and the chicken is cooked through, about 4 minutes more.\nStir in the Parmesan until well incorporated, and adjust the seasonings.\nTransfer the mixture to a serving bowl and sprinkle with the parsley, if desired. Serve hot and pass extra Parmesan at the table.\nWhen you add the Parmesan in Step 4, you can add any of the following to the pot, alone or in combination; stir over medium heat for another minute or two. 1 tablespoon pur\u00e9ed chipotles in adobo sauce 4 cups sliced mushrooms, saut\u00e9ed 3 cups lightly cooked tiny broccoli florets 2 tablespoons fresh herbs, such as oregano, thyme, or parsley Or, you can serve up portions of Chicken Alfredo Pasta for those who like it plain and simple, and add proportionate amounts of any of the add-ins to the pot.\nWhile it's certainly reasonable to thrill over a meal of reheated leftover Alfredo pasta, either warmed on the stovetop or in the microwave, this dish is best when it's made just before serving.",

Using your hands, shape the rice into a small, fat triangle, then use your thumb to create an indentation in the center. Place a teaspoonful of the salmon in the hollow, dampen your hands lightly again, and pat the rice over the hollow to encase the salmon. Repeat to create 3 more rice balls.\nDry your hands thoroughly. With the pointed end of the rice triangle facing the ceiling, wrap the nori around the bottom of each triangle, leaving the point showing between the open ends of the nori. Eat right away, or pack in your lunch box for later.\nYaki Onigiri (Grilled Rice Balls): These rice balls have no filling or nori. Instead, once compactly formed, they are brushed with soy or miso and broiled until they are crispy and chewy on the outside and soft on the inside. As they are broiling (or grilling), evenly drizzle both sides of each triangle with 1 teaspoon soy sauce or brush with 1 teaspoon white miso. Broil, turning once, until both sides are very browned. Do not allow them to burn; especially watch the miso, which can burn quickly. These onigiri are delicious hot.",

Steps:Heat butter and honey in a small saucepan over medium or in a microwave-safe bowl, stirring occasionally, until butter is melted. Pulse graham crackers in a food processor until fine crumbs form. With the motor running, drizzle in butter-honey mixture and process until well combined. Transfer mixture to a medium bowl.\nUsing an electric mixer on high speed, beat cream cheese in a large bowl until creamy, about 3 minutes. Add condensed milk and cocoa powder and beat until smooth.\nUsing a whisk or electric mixer on medium-high speed, whip cream in another medium bowl to stiff peaks. Gently fold into cocoa powder mixture.\nLine muffin pan with paper liners. Pour cocoa powder mixture into a pastry bag or plastic bag with the corner snipped off and pipe evenly into muffin cups. Top each with 1 1/2 Tbsp. cracker crumb mixture, breaking up crumbs to completely cover, then press down gently to adhere. Freeze until set, at least 3 hours.\nHeat corn syrup, sugar, and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan over low until sugar is melted. Increase heat to medium and cook until an instant-read thermometer registers 240\u02daF, about 5 minutes.\nMeanwhile, using electric mixer on medium-high speed (or a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment), beat egg whites and cream of tartar in a large bowl until soft peaks form. Reduce mixer speed to low and carefully add sugar syrup to egg whites in a slow and steady stream. Increase speed to high and beat until mixture is light, glossy, and fluffy, 6\u20138 minutes.\nRemove pies from molds, turn upside down, and remove paper liners. Dollop each pie with meringue. Using kitchen torch, carefully torch fluff. Serve immediately or return to freezer until ready to serve.\nPies (without topping) can be made 2 weeks ahead; cover and freeze.

Ingredients:['2 large yellow onions, peeled (about 1 pound)', '2 tablespoons unsalted butter', 'Kosher salt', 'Low-sodium chicken broth or water (for pan; optional)']. Steps:Halve both onions through root end. Using the tip of your knife, cut a V-shaped notch around root to remove it (this will ensure that all slices separate when you cut the onion).\nPlace 1 onion half on your cutting board so root end is facing you, then thinly slice onion lengthwise, starting at one side and working all the way to the other (so your knife runs through the root halfway through, not starting or ending at the root end). You\u2019re going for slices that are 1/4\"\u20131/8\" thick.\nRepeat same slicing procedure for remaining onion halves. It\u2019s a lot of onion! But it will cook down quite a bit, so it\u2019s best to start with a large quantity.\nHeat 2 Tbsp. butter in a large saucepan over medium until melted and sizzling. You can use a skillet to cook the onions, but a pan with high sides will keep the onions from flipping out onto your stove. Using a pan that also has a wide base gives water room to evaporate, allowing the onions to caramelize rather than steam.\nInstead of dumping in all of the onions at once, which would fill the pot and make it hard to stir (which would then cause the ones on the bottom to cook faster), start by adding just a couple of large handfuls to the pot. Cook, stirring, until onions are soft and starting to turn translucent, 1\u20132 minutes. Stir in a few more handfuls of onion and repeat cooking and stirring process until you\u2019ve added all the onions. Season with a pinch of salt.\nReduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook onions, stirring every few minutes to prevent them from sticking and coloring too much in any one place, until blonde-colored, 15\u201320 minutes. This is the point of doneness for French onion soup! If you feel like onions are getting too brown around the edges or they\u2019re sticking, reduce your heat a bit.\nIf you\u2019re going for onions that are both softer and more caramelized (say for a patty melt or onion dip), keep cooking, stirring on the regular, until onions are unmistakably golden brown, another 15\u201320 minutes. Because most of the water has cooked off at this point, there might be some bare spots where the pot could start to burn. If this happens, stir in a splash of broth or water. The liquid will dissolve the cooked-on bits, which the onions will re-absorb.\nFor extra-dark onions, the kind that make a great burger topping, cook until they start to almost blacken around the edges and go slightly crisp, another 10\u201315 minutes. This requires constant attention so they don\u2019t burn. No one said caramelized onions were quick!\nLet onions cool in the saucepan, then use or transfer to an airtight container and chill. They will keep up to 1 week.",

Steps:Wash the maple leaves with warm water and pat dry on paper towels. Line several cookie sheets with wax paper. Place the orange candy, green candy, and milk chocolate melting wafers into separate microwavable bowls. Microwave each bowl separately, stirring occasionally, until the candy is smooth, about 1 minute. Using a small, clean craft brush or your fingertip, paint spots in the 3 different colors of melted candy in an even layer (not too thin) over the top side of each leaf. While the candy is still wet, swirl the colors slightly to blend. Place the leaf on one of the cookie sheets, coated side up. Repeat with the remaining leaves. If the candy becomes too thick, reheat in the microwave for several seconds, stirring frequently. Place the cookie sheets in the refrigerator until the candy is set, about 5 minutes.\nCarefully peel the leaves from the hardened candy. They come off surprisingly easily. Use a toothpick or clean tweezers to remove any small pieces of leaf that may remain. (The leaves and other candy pieces can be made up to 5 days in advance, covered, and kept in a cool dry place.)\nLine a cookie sheet with wax paper. Spoon the remaining milk chocolate into a small bowl to use for the acorn tops. Soften 4 or 5 caramels at a time in the microwave for 3 to 4 seconds. Roll each caramel into an acorn (egg) shape. Place the chocolate jimmies in a small shallow bowl. Reheat the milk chocolate in the microwave, stirring often, until smooth, about 10 seconds. Dip the large end of an acorn caramel into the melted chocolate to cover about 1/4 inch. Allow any excess chocolate to drip off. While the acorn is still wet, dip the chocolate end into the jimmies to coat. Transfer to the cookie sheet. Repeat with the remaining acorns. Refrigerate until set, about 5 minutes.\nSpoon 1/4 cup of the chocolate frosting into a ziplock bag, press out the excess air, and seal. Spread the tops of the cupcakes with the remaining chocolate frosting and smooth. Arrange the cupcakes in pairs to make a circle on a large platter.\nGently press the leaves into the frosting on the cupcakes, overlapping them. The leaves on the edge of the right half of the wreath will sweep to the right, while those on the left half will sweep to the left. Place the acorns randomly over the cupcakes. Snip a 1/8-inch corner from the bag with the chocolate frosting and pipe a dot of frosting at the top of each acorn to make a stem.",

(Alternatively, turn off the oven after 1 hour and leave the fruit in the oven overnight. This will produce a more leathery result. Either way is good!)\nIn a medium bowl, combine 3 tablespoons of the lemon juice, the tahini, 3/4 cup water, salt, and the ice cube. Whisk vigorously until the mixture comes together. It should lighten in color and thicken enough that it holds an edge when the whisk is dragged through it.\nRemove the ice cube if any remains unmelted and adjust the seasoning, adding more lemon juice and salt until the sauce is addictive\u2014you will know. Scrape the sauce into a shallow serving dish and hide it from the eaters in your house until ready to serve.\nLayer a plate with the roasted fruit, then drizzle with the tahini dressing. Sprinkle with the reserved fresh thyme or oregano and a pinch of flaky sea salt.",

        "content": "We will be making Fried Potato and Garlic Puffs, here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['1 pound russet potatoes', 'Salt', '3 tablespoons unsalted butter', '1/2 cup all-purpose flour', '2 eggs', '1 garlic clove, pounded with a pinch of salt', 'At least 1 quart oil for frying']. Steps:Heat the oven to 225\u00b0F. Peel the potatoes, cut them in half lengthwise, and cut each half in 3. Boil the potatoes in well-salted water until they\u2019re completely tender but not falling apart, about 20 minutes. To check doneness, take a piece out of the pot and cut it at the thickest part. It should sort of break apart and look dry inside. Taste it to be sure, then drain the potatoes well, spread them on a baking sheet, and put them in the oven for 15 minutes to dry completely.\nPass them through a sieve or food mill into a medium bowl and set them aside. If you\u2019ll be cooking the puffs as soon as the dough is ready, leave the oven on so that you can keep batches warm as you fry.\nMeanwhile, make the p\u00e2te \u00e0 choux: In a medium saucepan, bring 1/2 cup water to a boil with the butter and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Add the flour all at once, turn off the heat, and stir with a wooden spoon until completely incorporated. Return the pan to very low heat and stir for a few minutes until the dough forms a ball and a cooked film begins to develop in the saucepan. Let the dough cool for a couple of minutes, and stir in one of the eggs. The dough will fly apart into seemingly irreconcilable blobs, but do not lose heart; keep stirring, and it will become one again, I promise.\nBeat the other egg in a small bowl and begin to stir it in\u2014you may not want to add all of it in the interest of dryness. Stop adding egg when the dough becomes elastic, smooth, and shiny, and then stir in the potato and garlic paste and mix thoroughly. The dough will be very sticky.\nIn a heavy saucepan or skillet, heat 2 to 3 inches of frying oil to 325\u00b0F, or until it is shimmery, not smoking, and a tiny dollop of the dough dropped in sizzles energetically, but does not scare you out of the kitchen. Carefully drop a walnut-size piece of dough into the oil to fry for a taster. Taste and adjust for salt and . . . more garlic? . . . cooked longer? There are two ways to proceed with frying: (1) load the dough into a pastry bag, squeeze out short lengths, and cut them off and into the oil with a knife or scissors, or (2) use two spoons to form and scrape dollops into the oil. Fry the puffs until they\u2019re golden brown, prodding them with a spider to roll them over and fry the other side as needed.\nDip them out to drain on a rack or crumpled paper and keep them warm in the oven (without the paper, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re using) as you fry the rest.\nInstead of serving the potato puffs alongside fish, meat, chicken, or beans, make them for a pre-dinner aperitivo that you stand around eating in the kitchen while you fry the next batch.\nIn spring, if green garlic stalks are available, thinly slice, rinse, and cook one in butter and a very little bit of salted water. When it\u2019s tender, drain and add it to the mix in place of the pounded garlic.\nAdd chopped chives, parsley, or thyme, or Parmesan or other gratable aged cheese to the dough.\nPotato-puff- frying oil can be strained and saved, refrigerated, to reuse for up to a week.",

Steps:Place the eggs in a shallow bowl and whisk to blend. In a second shallow bowl, combine the polenta, cheese, salt, and pepper.\nPour the oil into the saucepan or deep-fryer to a depth of at least 2 inches. If using a deep-fry thermometer to take the temperature of the oil, attach it to the side of the saucepan. Heat the oil over medium heat to 375\u00b0F, or until a wooden chopstick inserted into the oil begins to fizz with bubbles. Do not be tempted to use too high a heat to bring the oil to temperature, as it will be harder to control and keep stable once you arrive at your goal temperature.\nWhen the oil has come to temperature, coat the oysters: Dredge the oysters first in the eggs, allowing any excess to drip back into the bowl, then in the polenta mixture, shaking off any excess. Arrange on a platter. (The oysters should be fried within just a few moments of coating them.)\nFry the oysters in batches, about three at a time, until the breading is crisp, firm, and deep golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove with the wire skimmer and transfer to the paper towels to drain. Serve immediately with lemon wedges and a\u00efoli or lime mayonnaise.",

        "content": "We will be making Honey Brioche, here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['1/3 cup whole milk, lukewarm', '1 package (about 2 teaspoons) active dry yeast or instant yeast', '1 tablespoon mild, fragrant honey, such as lavender', '1 large egg, free-range and organic, lightly beaten', '2 cups unbleached, all-purpose flour', '1/3 cup mild, fragrant honey, such as lavender', '1 teaspoon fine sea salt', '4 large eggs, free-range and organic, lightly beaten', '1 1/2 cups unbleached, all-purpose flour', '3/4 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature', '1 large egg', 'free-range and organic', 'lightly beaten']. Steps:In the bowl of the heavy-duty mixer, combine the milk, yeast (see note if using instant yeast), and honey and stir to blend. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add the egg and half the flour and stir to blend. The sponge will be soft and sticky. Sprinkle with the remaining flour, to cover the sponge dough, but don\u2019t mix it in. Set aside to rest, uncovered, for 30 minutes. The sponge should erupt slightly, cracking the layer of flour. This indicates that the yeast is live and doing its job.\nAdd the honey, salt, eggs, and flour to the sponge. Mix at low speed just until the ingredients come together, about 1 minute. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat for 5 minutes.\nWhen the butter is incorporated, it should be the same consistency as the dough. To prepare the butter, place it on a flat work surface, and with the pastry scraper, smear it bit by bit across the surface. (If you do not have a pastry scraper, use the back of a large metal spoon.) When it is ready, the butter should be smooth, soft, but still cool\u2014not warm, oily, or greasy.\nWith the mixer on medium-low speed, add the butter a few tablespoons at a time. When all the butter has been added, increase the mixer speed to medium-high for 1 minute, then reduce the speed to medium and continue to beat for 5 minutes more. The dough will be soft and pliable but shouldn\u2019t stick to your hands.\nCover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise at room temperature until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours.\nPunch down the dough. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate the dough overnight, or for at least 4 hours, during which time it should double in size again.\nDivide the dough into 12 equal pieces, each weighing about 2 1/2 ounces. Roll each piece of dough tightly into a ball and place 6 pieces in each bread pan, staggering them in two rows of 3; there will be some space left at either end of the loaf but it will fill up when the dough rises again. Cover the pans with a clean cloth and let the dough rise at room temperature until doubled in bulk, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.\nCenter a rack in the oven. Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.\nLightly brush the dough with the beaten egg. Working quickly, using the tip of a pair of sharp scissors, snip a cross on the top of each ball of dough; this will help the brioche rise evenly as it bakes. Bake until the loaves are puffed and deeply golden, 30 to 35 minutes. Place the pans on the baking rack to cool. Turn the loaves out after they have cooled.\nWhen using instant yeast, there is no need to let the yeast proof in warm milk; it can be added directly to the flour. Don\u2019t omit the milk, however, as this will change the balance of liquid to dry ingredients in the recipe. Instant yeast and active dry yeast can be used interchangeably in the same quantities.\nHoney both enriches the flavor of this brioche and helps keep it moist. Top quality honey makes all the difference here.\nThe brioche is best eaten the day it is baked, although it can be tightly wrapped and stored for a day or two or frozen for up to 1 month. Thaw, still wrapped, at room temperature.",

Steps:Grease a 20cm (8-inch) springform tin and line with baking parchment.\nPut the dried sour cherries into a small saucepan with the sugar, vanilla, and 1 tablespoon of water. If you are using kirsch, add this now. Bring to the boil and leave to simmer for 4\u20135 minutes. The cherries should soften and absorb some of the liquid.

Steps:Whisk cocoa powder, salt, baking powder, and 2 1/2 cups flour in a medium bowl. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Reduce mixer speed to medium and add eggs and vanilla; beat until very fluffy, about 30 seconds. Reduce speed to low and gradually add dry ingredients, beating just until combined (use a large spatula to incorporate any dry ingredients at the bottom of the bowl). Divide dough in half and wrap each in plastic, pressing down to form into 1/2\u201d-thick disks. Chill until firm, at least 2 hours.\nPreheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Let 1 disk of dough sit at room temperature until softened slightly, about 5 minutes. Roll out on a lightly floured piece of parchment paper into a large 1/8\"-thick rectangle (about 16x12\"), dusting with more flour as needed. Use a knife and a ruler (precision is key) to cut into 4x1 1/2\" rectangles, then use a thin metal spatula to transfer rectangles to a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing 1\" apart. (If at any point the dough becomes too soft and sticky, slide dough with parchment onto a baking sheet and chill until firm.)\nChill dough on baking sheet while you repeat the process with the second disk of dough. You should end up with 30 cookies total. Save scraps for another use or discard. Prick cookies in several places with a fork. Bake, rotating baking sheets front to back and top to bottom halfway through, until edges are firm, 12\u201315 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets. Turn half of cookies over.\nLine a 13x9\u201d baking pan, preferably straight sided, with 2 layers of plastic wrap, leaving several inches of overhang on all sides; place in freezer. Remove both pints of first ice cream flavor from containers (just peel away container if it\u2019s paper, or use a rubber spatula to help slide ice cream out intact if container is plastic). Cut ice cream into 2\u201d pieces and place in a large bowl. Let sit until slightly softened, about 5 minutes, then stir with a wooden spoon or a large rubber spatula until the consistency of thick cake batter. Scrape ice cream into chilled pan and smooth into an even layer with a small off-set spatula. Freeze uncovered until firm, 15\u201320 minutes.\nRepeat softening process with both pints of second flavor.\nScrape second flavor over first layer and smooth out, spreading ice cream all the way to the edges and making top as level as possible. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until ice cream is hard, at least 8 hours.\nRemove ice cream from freezer, unwrap, and invert onto a cutting board; remove pan and peel off plastic. Trim sides of ice cream block to make a neat, straight-edged rectangle measuring 12x7 1/2\u201d (yep, there\u2019s that ruler again). Working quickly so ice cream doesn\u2019t melt, cut block lengthwise into 5 equal rows and then crosswise into thirds so you have 15 pieces measuring about 4x1 1/2\u201d Working with 1 brick of ice cream at a time, use a thin metal spatula to place on a flat-side-up cookie and top with a right-side up cookie. Transfer sandwiches to a rimmed baking sheet set in the freezer as you work. Freeze sandwiches until ice cream is hard, about 2 hours. Cover tray with plastic wrap and freeze at least another 8 hours to let cookies soften.\nDough can be made 2 days ahead; keep chilled.

Steps:If using a charcoal grill, fill chimney starter with charcoal; light and let burn until coals are covered with a thin layer of ash. Pour contents of chimney onto one side of grill. Arrange 3 chunks of wood or a handful of chips next to, not on top of, coals. (Placing them on top of the coals will cause them to burn too quickly; you want the wood to catch slowly and smolder.) Place grate on grill and cover grill, positioning vent on lid as far from heat source as possible. (This will help draw the smoke up and over the meat as it rises.)\nIf using a gas grill, prepare grill for medium-low indirect heat, leaving one or two burners off. Place wood chips in smoker box and set over direct heat; cover grill.\nStick an ovenproof probe thermometer through top vent if your grill has one. Heat until thermometer registers around 275\u00b0F, adjusting vents on bottom and top of grill or control knobs as needed to maintain temperature. Get any high-heat grilling done while you wait for the temperature to drop.\nMeanwhile, mix paprika, salt, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, chipotle chile powder, and mustard powder in a small bowl. Arrange wings on a large rimmed baking sheet and sprinkle half of rub over top. Turn over and sprinkle remaining rub over other side. Let sit at room temperature until grill is ready.\nPlace wings on grill over indirect heat, leaving a small gap between each piece to allow smoke to circulate. Smoke wings, replenishing wood as needed (and adding a coal or two of charcoal as needed), until deeply browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of each piece registers 165\u00b0F, 1 1/2\u20132 hours (as long as smoke is circulating well in grill, you shouldn\u2019t need to turn wings).\nJust before wings are done, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.

        "content": "We will be making Butterflied Chicken with Herbs and Cracked Olives, here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['2 (3 1/2\u20134)-pound chickens, backbones removed', 'Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper', '6 garlic cloves, finely grated', '1/4 cup Aleppo-style pepper', '1/4 cup finely chopped rosemary', '1/2 cup olive oil, divided', '1 cup Castelvetrano or other green olives, pitted, torn', '1/4 cup fresh lemon juice', '1/4 cup chopped oregano', '1/2 cup chopped parsley', 'plus leaves for serving']. Steps:The night before you plan to grill the chickens, place them on a work surface, breast side up, and open them up against the surface as much as possible. Using your palms, press firmly on breastbone to flatten breast. You may hear a crack. This means you\u2019re doing it right. Set chickens, breast side up, on a large rimmed baking sheet. Season generously on both sides with salt and black pepper. Chill, uncovered, at least 8 hours and up to 2 days.\nRemove chickens from refrigerator and set out on your counter. Combine garlic, Aleppo-style pepper, rosemary, and 1/4 cup oil in a small bowl. Rub chickens all over with mixture and let sit until room temperature, 1\u20132 hours.Prepare a grill for medium-high, indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill; for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off). Set chickens, skin side down, on grate over indirect heat. Cover grill, placing cover vent (if your grill has one) over chickens so it draws heat up and over them. Grill, rotating chickens as needed so that they color evenly, until skins are lightly browned, 15\u201320 minutes.Turn chickens and continue to cook, covered, until skins are deep golden brown and crisp and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breasts registers 160\u00b0F, 20\u201325 minutes. Transfer chickens to a cutting board and let rest at least 10 minutes before carving.Mix olives, lemon juice, oregano, chopped parsley, remaining 1/4 cup oil, and any accumulated juices from chicken on the cutting board in a medium bowl. Season with salt.To serve, arrange carved chickens on a platter and top with olive mixture and parsley leaves.",

        "content": "We will be making Breakfast Pizza with Sausage, Eggs, Spinach, and Cream, here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['1 ball of homemade or store-bought pizza dough (about 1-pound/304 g)', '3 ounces (85 g) fresh mozzarella, pinched into small chunks', '2 cups (220 g) shredded low-moisture mozzarella', '2 or 3 handfuls baby spinach', '1 large clove garlic, chopped or very thinly sliced', '1/2 cup (70 g) fresh sausage', '1/2 cup (120 ml) heavy cream', 'Fine sea salt', '2 large eggs', 'Freshly ground black pepper', '2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives', 'Crushed red pepper flakes', 'Extra-virgin olive oil', '3 tablespoons grated hard cheese']. Steps:Place your stone on the lowest shelf of your oven, then turn your oven to its highest temperature. Most ovens go to 500\u00b0F (260\u00b0C) and some to 550\u00b0F (287\u00b0C). Heat your stone for at least one hour before baking.\nIf you\u2019re taking your dough out of the fridge, give it about 15 minutes or so to warm up a bit so it will be easier to work with. It should have doubled in size in the fridge. If it hasn\u2019t, let it sit at room temperature, covered with a slightly damp towel, until it does.\nLightly flour your counter and your hands. Flip the dough into the flour bowl so the top side of the dough ball gets dusted first. Flip it once more, making sure that the dough is completely coated. Press the dough down into the flour, then pick it up and place it on the floured countertop.\nPressing your fingers firmly into the dough, start by flattening the center and work your way out toward the edge to make it wider, until it\u2019s about 7 to 9 inches (17 to 23 cm) wide. Pushing down on the dough will release some of the gas and actually begin opening up the dough. Be careful not to disturb the outermost lip. This will eventually become your crust.\nThe next step is a bit tricky. Your goal is to take this disc of dough and carefully stretch it to about 14 to 16 inches (35.5 to 40.5 cm) without tearing it or creating a hole. I pick it up with floured hands and begin to gently stretch it over my fists, letting gravity do most of the work.\nOnce you\u2019ve stretched it enough, put the dough back on the counter, making sure there is a generous dusting of flour underneath. Take a few generous pinches of semolina flour and dust your pizza peel. Make sure it\u2019s coated evenly. Gently lift and transfer your dough to the peel. Make sure both your hands and the peel are well-floured. You are now ready to dress your pie.\nStart by adding both mozzarellas to the dough, followed by the spinach and garlic. Add the sausage. Top with the cream and season with salt. Transfer to the oven. Bake for 3 minutes, then open the oven, pull out the rack with the baking stone, crack the eggs into the center of the pizza, and season them with salt and pepper. Push the rack back into the oven, close the door, and finish baking.\nThe crust will rise significantly. Then change the oven setting from bake to broil, cooking the pizza from the top down until the crust begins to blister. The residual heat of the stone will continue to cook the bottom. (If your broiler is at the bottom of your oven, skip this step and continue to bake the pizza as described.) I cook all my pizzas until they\u2019re well done, which could take up to 10 minutes total (sometimes less). Just keep checking so you don\u2019t burn it. Look for the cheese to color and the crust to turn deep brown. It may blacken in spots, and that\u2019s okay.\nWhen the pizza is done, remove it from the oven and finish with the chives, a pinch or two of crushed red pepper flakes, a drizzle of olive oil, and the grated hard cheese.",

Ingredients:['5 slices American deli-style cheese, halved, room temperature', '10 white, unseeded, soft white super market dinner rolls, split in half horizontally', '1 pound (455 g) fresh ground chuck, 80/20 or 70/30 meat-to-fat ratio (Josh prefers 70/30)', '1 large yellow onion (you can use a red onion if you like)', 'Kosher salt to taste', 'Oil, for cooking', 'Condiments of your choice']. Steps:Arrange the individual cheese slices and open the buns on a platter or cutting board near your cooking surface. Once the burgers start to cook, you will need them quickly. Divide the meat into 10 even portions. Roll each one into a meatball about the size of a ping-pong ball.\nDice the onion medium-fine and place in a small bowl. Add warm salted water just to cover and set beside the stove. Heat a skillet over high heat until very hot. If you have an infrared thermometer, the skillet should register at least 500\u00b0F (250\u00b0C). Or test by brushing on a bit of oil. When the skillet starts to smoke, it is ready.\nWhile the skillet is heating, working one at a time, flatten a meatball slightly and sprinkle it liberally on both sides with kosher salt. Salt drives much of this recipe. Brush oil onto the skillet and place the flattened ball on it. Just after it hits the pan, flip it over and using a solid, reinforced metal spatula, press hard to flatten it. You want it really thin. Do this just once, while the meat is still cold.\nAfter the burger has sizzled for about 30 to 40 seconds, top with about a tablespoon (15 g) of the watery onions. This will produce a good amount of onion fumes. That\u2019s okay. Spread the water and onions as evenly as you can and press them gently into the meat; don\u2019t squish down hard.\nWait another 30 seconds and taking great care to lift the meat from the pan with its crust intact, flip it over. Immediately put a slice of cheese on the meat and a bottom bun on top of the cheese. Wait another 10 to 15 seconds and remove onto a top bun. Invert onto serving platter and repeat to make 10 sliders. Serve with condiments of your choice.",

Ingredients:['Butter for the pan', '3 cups grated zucchini (about 2 smallish ones)', '3/4 teaspoon salt, plus more for salting the zucchini', '2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour', '2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder', '1 teaspoon baking soda', '1/2 teaspoon baking powder', '1 2/3 cups sugar', '1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened', '1/2 cup vegetable oil or light olive oil', '2 large eggs, at room temperature', '1 1/4 teaspoons vanilla extract', '1/2 cup sour cream, at room temperature', 'Chocolate Glaze']. Steps:Put the grated zucchini in a colander placed over a large bowl. Salt it lightly, tossing gently to mix. Set aside for 30 minutes to drain.\nPreheat the oven to 325\u00b0F (170\u00b0C). Butter a 9x9-inch cake pan.\nSift the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and 3/4 teaspoon salt into a bowl.\nCombine the sugar, butter, oil, eggs, and vanilla in another large bowl. Using an electric mixer (handheld is fine), beat the ingredients on medium-high speed for 2 minutes, until well blended. Add one-third of the dry mixture to the liquid and blend it in on low speed. Beat in half of the sour cream, followed by another third of the dry mixture, the rest of the sour cream, and the remaining dry mixture. The batter will start to get heavier late in the mixing, and you may want to do the last bit of mixing with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula.\nLift the zucchini out of the colander and give it a gentle squeeze, but don\u2019t squeeze out all the moisture. Add the zucchini to the batter and fold it in with a rubber spatula until evenly mixed. Scrape the batter into the pan and smooth with a spoon.\nBake the cake on the middle oven rack for 60 to 70 minutes, until a tester inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Transfer the cake to a cooling rack and cool thoroughly.\nWhen the cake has cooled, prepare the glaze, rewarming it if it has firmed up. When it has thickened slightly but is still thin enough to pour easily, slowly pour it over the cake, tilting the cake to spread it around. Cool for at least 10 minutes before slicing and serving.",

Steps:Blitz the digestive biscuits in a food processor until they are finely ground, or put them into a sealable bag, seal the bag and crush with a rolling pin. There shouldn\u2019t be any large pieces remaining.\nMake My Favourite Vanilla Cupcakes recipe, adding the digestive biscuit crumbs with the flour in step 1.\nTo make the filling, finely chop the chocolate and put it into a small bowl. Heat the butter and cream in a saucepan until steaming hot but not boiling, then pour over the chocolate. Remove from the heat and leave to stand for a minute before stirring to form a smooth ganache. If any lumps of chocolate remain, put the bowl into the microwave for ten seconds then stir; repeat until the lumps are gone. Chill in the fridge for 30 minutes or so, until it is firm and scoopable.\nTo make the marshmallow topping, put the sugar, golden syrup and 2 tablespoons of water into a saucepan and cook over a medium-high heat without stirring until the mixture reaches the soft-ball stage (244\u00b0F/118\u00b0C on a candy thermometer). If you don't have a thermometer, the mixture is ready when the bubbles start to stick together in the pan and it drips off a spoon in a steady stream. Remove from the heat.\nPut the egg whites into a clean, grease-free bowl and whisk with an electric hand-held whisk until soft peaks form. With the whisk on low, carefully pour the hot sugar onto the egg whites, whisking all the time. When all the sugar has been added, increase the speed to high and whip until the sides of the bowl feel only slightly warm and the mixture is thick and glossy. Add the vanilla extract at the end. This icing is easiest to pipe when it is warm, so transfer immediately to a piping bag fitted with a large circular nozzle or with the tip cut off.\nTo assemble, use a sharp knife or specialist cupcake corer to make a circular incision in the center of each cupcake, remove the center and fill each one with a teaspoon of the chocolate filling.\nPipe a large mound of marshmallow topping on the top of each cupcake, covering the chocolate filling. Use a blowtorch, if you have one, to lightly brown each one, avoiding the paper case as this will burn. You could use the broiler to brown the marshmallow topping, but watch carefully because it is more difficult to control the color and prevent it burning.\nTo finish, chop the chocolate squares finely and sprinkle over the top of the marshmallow.",

Ingredients:['2 green cabbages (about 2 kg/4 lb 6 oz), shredded', '50 g (1 3/4 oz) fine ground salt (about 2.5%)', '15 g (1/2 oz) caraway seeds (optional)', '2 L (68 fl oz) jar', 'pounder (a heavy implement like the end of a rolling pin', 'potato masher', 'or cocktail muddler)', 'follower (a whole cabbage leaf or small plate)', 'weight (see note)']. Steps:Weigh the shredded cabbage (as cabbages vary in size and weight) to ensure the salt to cabbage ratio is correct. The amount of salt you use should come to about 1.5\u20132.5%, but no more than 3%, of the cabbage weight.\nIn a large bowl, mix and massage the salt through the cabbage thoroughly, making sure to distribute the salt evenly.\nLet it sit to sweat a bit\u2014maybe 10 minutes. This is simply to make the next step easier. This is a good time to get your vessel cleaned and to rest up for the next stage.\nWith your pounder, pound quite energetically for about 5\u201310 minutes, until the cabbage is dripping with its own salty water when you pick up a handful. This part is important as you need this liquid\u2014it\u2019s your brine.\nYou can also use the dough hook of a stand mixer to do the pounding part, which can speed things up somewhat. Don\u2019t let it run for too long though, only a few minutes. Using a mixer is easy and great for people who are doing this a lot and in large batches, but it takes quite a bit of the emotional release and fun out of it.\nNext, mix in the caraway seeds (if using).\nPut the mixture into the jar, packing it down tightly as you go using the pounder. Push down well, particularly at the end to coax out any more brine. You need the brine to cover the cabbage.\nDon\u2019t pack the cabbage all the way to the top; leave some headroom at the top of the jar to allow for a bit of growth and movement and, of course, the weight. You don\u2019t want the liquid touching the top of the lid, as it will end up spewing out of your air-lock or up out of your lid.\nCover with a cabbage leaf (the follower), the weight and then your chosen lid or system.\nDepending on your ferment, you can start trying it as soon as you\u2019d like, but the less you fiddle with it in the first 2 weeks, the better. It is ready when you think it is delicious. With the right system and temperature, you can leave it to ferment for months before refrigeration.\nIf you used a crock, you\u2019ll need to decant the kraut to smaller jars before you refrigerate, unless you have a walk-in cool room, or large cellar. (Lucky you.) It will keep in the fridge for 12 months or more. Use your senses.",

Roll the pastry dough out into a circle about 13 inches across, trimming the edges so they are even. Transfer the dough to a sheet of parchment paper.

Steps:In a medium saucepan, warm the olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add the garlic, chili powder, and cumin. Cook until fragrant, stirring constantly, about 30 seconds. Add the tomato paste and saut\u00e9 for another minute, stirring constantly. Add the rinsed quinoa and water, and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then cover the pot and reduce the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook until the liquid is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes (the quinoa might not be fluffy yet, but don\u2019t worry).\nRemove the pot from the heat and let it rest, still covered, for 5 minutes. Then, uncover and fluff the quinoa with a fork. Gently stir in the black beans and salt. Season to taste with pepper and additional salt, if necessary. Cover and set aside for a couple of minutes to warm up the beans.\nIn a large skillet, warm the olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Toss in the tortilla strips, sprinkle them with salt, and stir. Cook until the strips are crispy and turning golden, stirring occasionally, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain the tortilla strips on a plate covered with a piece of paper towel.\nIn a small food processor or blender, combine the lime juice, olive oil, and water. Using a spoon, scoop in the half avocado and add the cilantro, jalape\u00f1o, garlic, and salt. Process until the dressing is nice and smooth. The dressing should be zippy, but if it\u2019s unpleasantly tart or difficult to blend, dilute it with 1 to 2 tablespoons of water and blend again.\nCombine the romaine and arugula in a large bowl. Wait to dress the salad until you are ready to serve, as the greens wilt fairly quickly once dressed. (If you won\u2019t be consuming all 4 servings of this salad right away, portion off the greens you\u2019d like to save for later, and dress only the greens you intend to eat now.)\nWhen you\u2019re ready, drizzle the mixture with just enough dressing to lightly coat the greens (you might have extra). Toss until the dressing is evenly distributed.\nArrange the dressed greens in 4 individual salad bowls (or dinner plates, if your bowls are on the small side). Top each salad with taco filling, tomatoes, radishes, crispy tortilla strips, and feta. Slice the remaining avocado half into long strips and place a couple of strips on each salad. Serve immediately.\nIf you have leftover dressing, press plastic wrap against the surface to prevent browning and store it in the refrigerator for later. Leftover tortilla strips tend to become unpalatably tough within a couple of hours, so you might want to skip those and add a few crushed tortilla chips to leftovers.",

Steps:Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Butter a 9x5-inch loaf pan and set it aside.\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. When the water is at a rolling boil, add the pasta. Cook the pasta until it is slightly underdone, checking a few minutes before the cooking time on the package directions. (If you bite into a piece, you should be able to see a very thin core of uncooked pasta.) Drain the pasta and set aside.\nMelt the 3 tablespoons butter in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the flour to the melted butter, whisking constantly. Continue to whisk for 2 minutes. Add the milk, 1/2 cup at a time, waiting until the mixture is thoroughly combined before adding more. Whisk constantly over medium-low heat until the mixture thickens to the consistency of heavy cream, about 5 minutes.\nTurn off the heat, add the mustard, 1 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper, and stir.

Set aside the slice and repeat with the remaining slices.\nCoat both sides of the waffle iron grid with nonstick spray. Place the macaroni and cheese slices in the waffle iron, close the lid, and cook until heated through and golden brown, 3 minutes.\nThe extraction process can be tricky. With a silicone spatula, loosen the edges of the macaroni and cheese. Use the spatula to gently pry the macaroni and cheese from the waffle iron and then support the bottom with the spatula while you lift it out with tongs.\nRepeat Steps 5 through 7 until all of the macaroni and cheese has been waffled.

Steps:Place the ricotta in a cheesecloth-lined sieve and set the sieve over a bowl. Cover the ricotta with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours or up to one day. Discard the liquid in the bowl.\nPass the tomatoes through a food mill fitted with the fine disc. (If you don\u2019t have a food mill, seed the tomatoes and place them in a food processor. Process the tomatoes, using quick on/off pulses, until they are finely ground. Don\u2019t overprocess, or you\u2019ll incorporate air into the tomatoes and change their texture and color.)

The shell should be filled to capacity but not overstuffed. Nestle the shells next to each other in the baking dish as you fill them. Spoon the remaining sauce over the shells, coating each one. Arrange the slices of mozzarella in an even layer over the shells. Bake until the mozzarella is browned and bubbling, about 25 minutes. Remove, and let stand 5 minutes before serving.",

Steps:Place sugar in a deep, heavy saucepan set over medium heat. Stir continuously and break up any lumps of sugar\u2014this will help the sugar caramelize evenly. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring with a spatula to dissolve the sugar, then simmer, without stirring, until the caramel turns the color of a copper penny (or an Irish setter), about 4 minutes. If, while the caramel cooks, any sugar crystallizes on the sides of the pan, brush down the sides with a clean, wet pastry brush. Reduce the heat to low, and slowly add 1/2 cup of the cream (the caramel will rise and bubble and might spit, so be careful). Stir until the cream is well incorporated into the caramel. Remove from the heat and stir in salt. Should the caramel seize and harden, return the mixture to the heat and stir until it softens.

Steps:Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0C (350\u00b0F). Grease three 18cm (7 inch) cake tins and line with parchment paper.\nPut the butter, sugars, flour, baking powder, malt powder and salt into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on low until all the butter is rubbed into the dry mixture and it has a sandy texture. Alternatively, rub the butter into the dry ingredients by hand, as if you were making pastry.\nIn a small jug, beat together the milk, eggs and vanilla. Pour the mixture down the side of the bowl into the dry ingredients and beat until everything is mixed together. When all the liquid has been added, beat on a high speed for two minutes until it is well combined and smooth. Alternatively, you could use an electric hand-held whisk.\nDivide the mixture evenly between the prepared tins and bake in the preheated oven for 25\u201330 minutes until golden brown. The cake will look slightly darker than you might expect with the added malted milk powder, so be more vigilant in checking that it is ready.\nHeat the milk and malted milk powder in a small saucepan. Whisk until all the lumps of powder have dissolved and the mixture has thickened slightly. Set aside to cool. Beat the butter in a large bowl until smooth, then gradually add the icing sugar and cool malted milk paste. Use an electric hand-held whisk to beat the buttercream for 5\u201310 minutes until light and fluffy. It should hold its shape but still be fairly soft.\nTo assemble the cake, stack the bottom two layers on top of each other and use a circular 9cm cutter to remove the middle. Press through both layers at once to make sure the holes line up.\nPut the bottom ring on a cake stand and cover the top with a layer of buttercream using a palette knife. Try not to get icing too close to the middle, because moisture on the sweets will cause them to become sticky.\nPut the second ring on top of the first and fill the hole with milk bottle sweets. Make sure it is filled to the same level as the sponge or the top sponge will cave in. Cover the second ring with buttercream then add the final sponge. Thinly cover the whole cake with some of the buttercream to trap any crumbs, then chill for a minimum of 30 minutes.\nCover the cake with the remaining buttercream, placing a large dollop on the top to create a swirl. Decorate using more milk bottle sweets and coloured paper straws.",

Steps:Brush the onion slices with a little olive oil and season with kosher salt and pepper. On a hot griddle pan or in a cast-iron skillet, grill the onion until tender. Separate into rings and chop very fine.\nLightly brush a 7 1/2 X 11-inch baking dish with olive oil and preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.\nIn a large mixing bowl, combine the chopped grilled onion, lamb, pork, mustard, garlic, coriander, espelette, fresh herbs, scallion, and eggs. Season liberally with kosher salt and pepper and thoroughly combine the mixture with clean hands. Transfer to the baking dish and spread out evenly to the edges, smoothing the top flat. Place the dish inside a larger roasting pan and add boiling water to about halfway up the sides of the baking dish.\nBake for 45 minutes, or until the gyro shrinks away from the sides and is quite hot in the middle when pierced with a metal skewer (around 150\u00b0F). Remove the pan from the water bath and cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or, ideally, 24 hours, to develop the flavors.\nPlace a large, flat platter upside down over the baking dish. Turn both over, and carefully remove the gyro. With a hot, sharp knife, slice the gyro about 3/8 inch thick. In a very large skillet, warm 1/3 cup oil over medium-high heat. When the oil is very hot, add the gyro slices and saut\u00e9 for about 2 minutes, shaking the pan around to thoroughly coat the slices with the oil.\nPaint the pita with extra-virgin olive oil, season with kosher salt and pepper, and grill until firm and char-marked on all sides. Smear some Tzatziki in the center of each pita round. Divide the gyro meat among the pitas, on top of the tzatziki. Add some Greek Salad. Pull the sides of the pita up to meet in the center, like a taco. Serve like a taco, or wrap and secure with a wide strip of parchment. Messy and great!",

        "content": "We will be making Cooked Semi-Polished Rice (Haiga Mai), here are the ingredients and steps. Ingredients:['1 cup Japanese-style semi-polished rice', '1 cup plus 3 tablespoons water, soft tap or filtered', '1 1/2 cups Japanese-style semi-polished rice', 'Generous 1 3/4 cups', 'soft tap or filtered water']. Steps:As already noted, great care must be taken when washing partially polished rice to avoid dislodging the nutrient-rich germ. Place the rice in a deep bowl and pour in enough cool tap water just to cover the grains. Using your fingertips in gentle swirling, swishing motions, rinse the grains for about 15 seconds. With slightly scooping motions, gently lift the grains once or twice, to ensure that water flows freely around each grain. Drain the rice. Use your hand or a fine-mesh strainer to hold back the rice as you drain off the water. Some people find it useful to line their strainer with fine-woven cloth (the Japanese use sarashi) or a clean, low-lint kitchen towel. Carefully transfer the rice to a pot or rice-cooker bowl.\nPlace the washed and drained rice in a sturdy, straight-sided pot. A 2- or 3-quart size will work well for the two smaller quantities, and a 4- to 6-quart pot is appropriate for the larger amount. Add the water. Ideally, the rice should sit in its measured water for 10 minutes before cooking, but if you are pressed for time, add a few extra drops of water and cook right away. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid.\nBring the water to a rolling boil over high heat. You will hear bubbling noises and see the lid begin to dance after several minutes. An onomatopoeic folk jingle that describes the cooking of rice refers to this bubbling stage as choro choro. Reduce the heat and continue to cook until the water is absorbed (about 5 minutes). You will know this point has been reached when you hear a low hissing sound (the folk jingle calls this naka pappa). If it is difficult to rely on the sound of the cooking and you must check visually on progress along the way, peek quickly, replacing the lid immediately.\nIncrease the heat to high again for 30 seconds to dry off the rice. Remove the pot from the heat and let the rice stand, still tightly covered, for at least 10 minutes. Even if you wish to serve the rice piping hot, these final minutes of self-steaming (called murasu) are necessary to achieve the proper texture.\nPlace the washed and drained rice in the bowl of your cooker. Add the water. It is important to use cool liquid when cooking rice in a thermostatically controlled appliance; using warm or hot liquid from the start will cut short the cooking cycle. Close the lid, press the start switch, and let the appliance do the cooking. The time required to complete the cooking cycle will vary with the appliance, but most models take about 40 minutes to cook 1 to 1 1/2 cups raw rice.",
