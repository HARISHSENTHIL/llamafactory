    "Question": "Taking into account the content of Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Would additional process validation studies be needed to support a change in the source of an API starting material?",
    "Answer": "Any change in the API starting material should be assessed for impact on the API manufacturing process and the resulting API quality (ICH Q7, paragraph 7.14). Additional validation studies of the API process may be warranted if the change in the API starting material is deemed significant. In most cases, validation would be expected for a different source of the starting material unless otherwise justified (ICH Q7, paragraphs 12.1, 13.13)."

    "Question": "According to the E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs \n\nS7B Nonclinical Evaluation of the Potential for Delayed Ventricular Repolarization (QT Interval Prolongation) by Human Pharmaceuticals  To predict whether or not the hERG block poses a risk of interfering with ventricular repolarization or TdP, evaluation of the hERG safety margin based on results of a best practice assay (see S7B Q&As Q18 (1.2) and Q19 (2.1)) is recommended. ICH S7A guidance, section II.F (2.6) describes considerations for when human metabolite(s) should be assessed with in vitro systems. In these cases, the metabolite's hERG safety margin should also be evaluated.",
    "Answer": "A drug with low TdP risk would be expected to have (1) a hERG safety margin higher than a threshold defined based on the safety margins computed under the same experimental protocol for a series of drugs known to cause TdP (see ICH S7B Q&A Q18 (1.2) for additional details); and (2) no QTc prolongation in an in vivo assay of sufficient sensitivity conducted at exposures of parent compound and major human metabolites that exceed clinical exposures. See ICH S7A guidance, section II.F (2.6) for considerations of human metabolite(s) in the in vitro or in vivo nonclinical assays. If these results are used to support an integrated clinical and nonclinical risk assessment strategy as described in ICH E14 Q&As Q12 (5.1) and Q13 (6.1), no additional nonclinical studies are needed. When there are factors that can confound or limit the interpretation of the nonclinical studies, such as metabolites and heart rate changes, follow-up studies as described in the ICH S7B guidance (section II.C.5 (2.3.5)) can be performed to address these specific issues."

    "Question": "As stated in Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Do sugars found in fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the form of the fruit or vegetable (e.g., concentrated fruit and vegetable pures, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders) need to be declared as added sugars on the label?",
    "Answer": "In the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833), we explained that we excluded from the definition of \"added sugars\" whole fruit, fruit pieces, dried fruit, pulps, and pures because they are nutrient rich and maintain the basic properties of a fruit when added to foods and are not considered to contain added sugars (see response to comment 208, 81 FR 33742 at33835). We also explained that sugars from 100 percent fruit and vegetable juices, and sugars from certain fruit and vegetable juice concentrates used towards the total juice percentage label declaration under certain regulations, fruit juice concentrates used to formulate the fruit component of jellies, jams, and preserves under our standards of identity, and 100 percent juice concentrate sold directly to consumers (e.g. frozen orange juice concentrate) are excluded from the definition of \"added sugars.\"\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833 through 33834), we explained that, while foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices can be a part of a healthful diet, the sugars added to the foods by the concentrated fruit or vegetable juice provide additional calories. Over the course of the day, small amounts of calories in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages can add up and make it difficult to balance the amount of calories expended (81 FR 33742 at 33834). For these reasons, we consider foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices to be sugar-sweetened foods (id).\n\nWe also explained that in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) report (Ref. 1) (81 FR 33742 at 33835)."

    "Answer": "To demonstrate the general approach described above, we provide two hypothetical examples below. In these hypothetical examples, we use the Brix value as an estimate for the sugar concentration.\n\nHypothetical example 1:\n\nA product formulation contains a single juice ingredient (5% apple juice at 70 Brix value). The finished product has a serving size of 250 gm and a moisture content of 50%.\n\nStep 1: The amount of total sugars in the juice ingredient = weight per serving \\(\\times\\) percentage apple juice concentrate \\(\\times\\) % sugar in apple juice concentrate = 250 g \\(\\times\\) 5% \\(\\times\\) 70% = 8.75 g.\n\nStep 2: The water content or the moisture content of the finished product = weight per serving \\(\\times\\) moisture content = 250 g \\(\\times\\) 50% = 125 g.\n\nStep 3: The apple juice sugar concentration if we assume all of the water in the finished product is used to reconstitute the apple juice = 8.75 g / 125 g = 7%.\n\nBecause 7% is less than the sugar concentration in the theoretical single strength apple juice (11.5 Brix value), the added sugar from the apple juice ingredient in this hypothetical example is zero even though the starting ingredient is a concentrated apple juice.\n\nHypothetical example 2 (with drying step where water is removed):_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nA product formulation contains a single juice ingredient (20% single strength apple juice at 11.5 Brix) in the wet formulation (prior to drying). The blended wet formulation has a water content of 50% (i.e., a solids content of 50%). The product goes through a drying step. The finished product has a water content of 10% (i.e., a solids content of 90%) and a serving size of 40 g.\n\nStep 1: The amount of total sugars contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving.\n\nBecause there is water loss during manufacturing, in this method we calculate the amount of wet formulation needed to yield 40 g serving size finished product.\n\n* Solids content in the finished product g = 40 x 90% = 36 g.\n* Because the solids prior to drying is 50% (moisture = 50%), the starting wet formulation prior to drying that yielded the 40 g serving size finished product is 72 g (36 g / 50%).\n* The amount of total sugar contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving (based on wet formulation weight percentage) = 72 g \\(\\times\\) 20% \\(\\times\\) 11.5% = 1.656 g.\n\nStep 2: The water content of the finished product = weight per serving \\(\\times\\)moisture content = 40 g \\(\\times\\) 10% = 4 g.\n\nStep 3: The apple juice sugar concentration if we assume all of the water in the finished product is used to reconstitute the apple juice = (1.656 g/ 4 g) \\(\\times\\) 100 = 41.4%."

    "Answer": "Generally, as discussed in the answer to Q5, procedures consisting of more than a single operation are not considered the same surgical procedure.\n\nHowever, under limited circumstances, surgical removal and subsequent implantation of the autologous HCT/P may be considered same surgical procedure even though the removal and future implantation may be a number of days apart. During this time, the HCT/P may be rinsed or cleansed andtemporarily stored after being labeled, pending implantation, and this would still be considered the same surgical procedure, provided no other processing steps and no other manufacturing steps beyond labeling and storage are performed.7\n\nFootnote 7: Temporary storage of a cranial bone flap or portion of parathyroid tissue may include steps to preserve those HCT/Ps in an appropriate condition for reimplantation, such as disinfecting or cryopreservation.\n\nEstablishments that perform the following procedures consisting of more than a single operation generally would qualify for the exception in 21 CFR 1271.15(b):\n\n1. Cranitotomy or craniectomy with subsequent implantation of the bone flap to reverse the cranial defect.\n2. Parathyroidectomy with subsequent implantation of a portion of the tissue to preserve parathyroid function.\n\nThe exception generally applies only to those establishments that both remove and implant the autologous HCT/P at the same establishment. An establishment that removes an HCT/P for implantation into the same individual, but intends the HCT/P to be implanted at a different establishment, would not qualify for the exception. Shipping the HCT/P to another establishment for implantation raises safety concerns, such as contamination and cross-contamination, beyond those typically associated with surgery. The establishment shipping the autologous HCT/P for use at another establishment is distributing the HCT/P8, which is a manufacturing9 step, and therefore the shipping establishment must register, submit an HCT/P list under Part 1271, Subpart B, and follow all other applicable regulations in Part 1271.10\n\nFootnote 8: \u201cDistribution\u201d means any conveyance or shipment (including importation and exportation) of an HCT/P that has been determined to meet all release criteria, whether or not such conveyance or shipment is entirely intrastate (21 CFR 1271.3(bb)).\n\nFootnote 9: \u201cManufacture\u201d means, but is not limited to, any or all steps in the recovery, processing, storage, labeling, packaging, or distribution of any human cell or tissue, and the screening or testing of the cell or tissue donor (21 CFR 1271.3(e)).\n\nFor craniotomy, craniectomy, or parathyroidectomy procedures, FDA recognizes that under limited circumstances, in order to accommodate the medical needs of an individual patient, there may be a medical necessity for the establishment that removed the_autologous cranial bone flap or portions of parathyroid tissue to send the HCT/Ps to a different establishment for reimplantation in the patient. In such cases, provided precautions will be taken to protect the HCT/P from contamination and cross-contamination, FDA does not intend to object to the recovering establishment sending the autologous cranial bone flap or portions of parathyroid tissue to a different establishment for reimplantation in the patient, without registering and listing with the FDA."

Please indicate whether and when these studies should be conducted.",
    "Answer": "Presumably, the pharmacodynamic activities and pharmacokinetic profile, including the effects on the CYP450s of the individual drugs, are known before the drugs are combined. Because potential pharmacodynamic interactions are anticipated based on the nonclinical and clinical experiences with the individual entities or their combination, no nonclinical pharmacodynamic interaction studies are warranted. If the pharmacology information indicates potential interactions that could lead to toxicity, then combination nonclinical toxicity studies might be warranted.\n\nConcerns regarding pharmacokinetic interactions can often be addressed by lowering the initial doses administered below those that might be appropriate for the individual drugs or by conducting a clinical pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction study."

(1.1)",
    "Answer": "The document recommends that the reader should be skilled, but it does not identify specific training that is needed. A technician reading with a cardiologist over-reading the document would certainly be consistent with the guidance. The attempt of the guidance to limit the number of readers represents an attempt to increase consistency. The guidance asks for assessment of intra- and inter-reader variability and suggests \"a few skilled readers\" (not necessarily a single reader) to analyze a whole thorough QT study, since many readers may increase variability. Training would be another way to improve consistency.\n\nIt is recommended for the thorough QT Study that core ECG laboratories blind subject, time, and treatment in order to reduce potential bias.

    "Question": "Given the context of E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , How can assessment of the concentration-response relationship guide the interpretation of QTc data?",
    "Answer": "Concentration-response analysis, in which all available data across all doses are used to characterize the potential for a drug to influence QTc, can serve as an alternative to the by-time-point analysis or intersection-union test as the primary basis for decisions to classify the risk of a drug. In either case, this result is an important component of the totality of evidence assessment of the risk of QT prolongation. The overall assessment of risk of QT prolongation includes nonclinical data, the time course of QT prolongation, the magnitude of QT prolongation, categorical analyses of outliers, and certain adverse events in patients that can signal potential proarrhythmic effects.\n\nThere are many different types of models for the analysis of concentration-response data, including descriptive pharmacodynamic (PD) models (e.g., linear or E\\({}_{\\text{max}}\\) models), or empirical models that link pharmacokinetic (PK) models (dose-concentration-response) with PD models. Itis recognized that concentration-response analyses of the same data using models with different underlying assumptions can generate discordant results. Therefore, it is important that the modeling methods and assumptions, criteria for model selection, rationale for model components, and potential for pooling of data across studies be specified prior to analysis to limit bias. Prospective specification of model characteristics (e.g., structural model, objective criteria, goodness of fit) based on knowledge of the pharmacology is recommended whenever possible. On occasion, the QT effect is not a direct function of plasma concentration. For example, drugs that cause QT prolongation as a result of changes in protein synthesis or trafficking or drugs with accumulation into myocardial tissues might demonstrate hysteresis. Testing for model assumptions, hysteresis (a plot of data by-time point and a hysteresis loop plot), and goodness of fit should be documented.\n\nConcentration-response analysis can be challenging when more than one molecular entity--multiple drugs or parent plus metabolites--contributes to the QTc effect."

However, the MAH should always discuss the acceptability of this approach with the relevant regulatory authority or authorities, noting that this approach is not an attempt to amend local reporting periodicity, but rather an opportunity to use the 12-month document to fulfill the shorter reporting period requirement."

    "Question": "As described in Treatment Use of Investigational Drugs Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, How does FDA address individual patient expanded access applications for treatment with multiple courses of therapy or treatment of a chronic condition?",
    "Answer": "Under 21 CFR 312.310(c)(1), individual patient expanded access is generally limited to a single course of therapy for a specified duration. However, as reflected in SS 312.310(c)(1), FDA may authorize multiple courses of therapy or chronic therapy for individual patient expanded access, including authorizing individual patient expanded access to treat a chronic disease or condition that requires extended treatment. FDA generally authorizes such individual patient expanded access when the circumstances of the treatment are well defined and reasonable in light of the available evidence to support use of the drug. The patient's physician (as the investigator) proposes the full course of treatment when filing the request for expanded access. To fairly weigh the risks and benefits of a drug for use for individual patient expanded access, FDA believes the planned course of therapy should be well defined because it will usually be necessary to consider the planned dose and duration of therapy in relation to what is known about the occurrence of toxicity for that dose and duration of therapy. Therefore, FDA typically authorizes expanded access for an extended duration for the treatment of a chronic condition when the patient's condition and the information available about the safety of the drug support an extended duration of treatment, but FDA does not typically authorize expanded access for an unspecified duration at the discretion of the patient's physician. For example, FDA may authorize expanded access of extended duration for a drug being developed to treat multiple sclerosis or other types of progressively debilitating neuromuscular disease if it is critical that the drug be administered chronically to slow the progression of the disease and if the information available about the safety of the drug supports an extended duration of treatment. If expanded access use is authorized for an extended duration, FDA may require the sponsor to continue to monitor the individual patient expanded access use through the extended duration (see SS 312.310(c)(3))."

    "Question": "Drawing from the insights of FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What are significant risk (SR) device studies?",
    "Answer": "A significant risk device means an investigational device that:\n\n* Is intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n* Is purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n* Is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n* Otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. (21 CFR 812.3(m))\n\nSponsors of investigational SR device studies are required to get an approved IDE from FDA before starting their study. 21 CFR 812.20 (FDA gives each IDE a number - for example #GXX0000, where XX denotes the year of the submission). Sponsors and clinical investigators of these studies must comply with the regulations at 21 CFR Part 812, \"Investigational Device Exemptions.\"\n\nIf FDA disapproves an IDE, FDA's letter will describe the reasons for the disapproval. If the sponsor submits an IDE amendment satisfactorily addressing the issues in FDA's letter, the agency sends an IDE approval letter to the sponsor. In accordance with the regulations at Part 812, the study may not start until both FDA and the IRB have given their approval.\n\nNote: A conditional approval letter from FDA allows the study to begin if the study is approved by the IRB, but requires the sponsor to provide additional clarifying information in order to obtain full approval for the study.\n\nIRBs do not have to make the SR or NSR determination if FDA has already made the risk determination. Most often, clinical investigators submit SR device investigations for IRB review after the study has already received IDE approval from FDA. IRBs may ensure that SR device investigations have an FDA-approved IDE by asking the clinical investigator to request from the sponsor a copy of FDA's IDE approval letter."

The tamper-evident statement describes the tamper-evident feature of the drug product package and advises consumers that, if the feature is breached or missing when the drug product is purchased, tampering may have occurred. Tamper-evident packaging with an appropriate labeling statement will be more likely to protect consumers because the consumer will be in a better position to detect tampering when he or she has knowledge that a tamper-evident feature has been incorporated into the drug product design. We allow flexibility in the placement of this statement on the package and do not require that it be included within the Drug Facts section.

    "Question": "Upon checking the information in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , Can a sponsor use comparative animal or clinical data with a non-U.S.-licensed product to support a demonstration that the proposed product is biosimilar to the reference product? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]",
    "Answer": "A sponsor may use a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product in certain studies to support a demonstration that the proposed biological product is biosimilar to the U.S.-licensed reference product. However, as a scientific matter, analytical studies and at least one clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) study, which may include pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoint(s) intended to support a demonstration of biosimilarity, must include an adequate comparison of the proposed biosimilar product directly with the U.S.-licensed reference product unless it can be scientifically justified that such a study is not needed.\n\nIf a sponsor seeks to use data from an animal study6 or a clinical study comparing its proposed biosimilar product to a non-U.S.-licensed product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act, the sponsor should provide adequate data or information to scientifically justify the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity and establish an acceptable bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. As a scientific matter, the type of bridging data needed will always include data from analytical studies(e.g., structural and functional data) that directly compare all three products (i.e., the proposed biosimilar product, the U.S.-licensed reference product, and the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product), and is likely to also include bridging clinical PK data or, when appropriate, PD data, for all three products. All three pairwise comparisons should meet the prespecified acceptance criteria for analytical and PK or PD similarity. The acceptability of such an approach will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and should be discussed in advance with the Agency. For certain complex biological products, a modified approach may be needed. A final determination about the adequacy of the scientific justification and bridge will be made during the review of the application.\n\nIssues that a sponsor may need to address to use a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product in a biosimilar development program include but are not limited to the following:"

    "Answer": "Section 351(k) of the PHS Act, added by the BPCI Act, sets forth, among other things, the requirements for an application for a proposed biosimilar product and an application or a supplement for a proposed interchangeable product. Section 351(i) defines \"biosimilarity\" to mean \"that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components\" and that \"there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product\" (section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act). A 351(k) application must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product based upon data derived from analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies, unless FDA determines, in its discretion, that certain studies are unnecessary in a 351(k) application (see section 351(k)(2) of the PHS Act). To meet the standard for \"interchangeability,\" an applicant must provide sufficient information to demonstrate biosimilarity, and also to demonstrate that the biological product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient and, if the biological product is administered more than once to an individual, the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the biological product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch (see section 351(k)(4) of the PHS Act).

Has this investigation yielded a reasonable approach to concentration-response modeling during drug development? How can assessment of the concentration-response relationship guide the interpretation of QTc data? (5.1)",
    "Answer": "Concentration-response analysis, in which all available data across all doses are used to characterize the potential for a drug to influence QTc, can serve as an alternative to the by-time-point analysis or intersection-union test as the primary basis for decisions to classify the risk of a drug. In either case, this result is an important component of the totality of evidence assessment of the risk of QT prolongation. The overall assessment of risk of QT prolongation includes nonclinical data, the time course of QT prolongation, the magnitude of QT prolongation, categorical analyses of outliers, and certain adverse events in patients that can signal potential proarrhythmic effects.\n\nThere are many different types of models for the analysis of concentration-response data, including descriptive pharmacodynamic (PD) models (e.g., linear or E\\({}_{\\text{max}}\\) models), or empirical models that link pharmacokinetic (PK) models (dose-concentration-response) with PD models. It is recognized that concentration-response analyses of the same data using models with different underlying assumptions can generate discordant results. Therefore, it is important that the modeling methods and assumptions, criteria for model selection, rationale for model components, and potential for pooling of data across studies be specified prior to analysis to limit bias. Prospective specification of model characteristics (e.g., structural model, objective criteria, goodness of fit) based on knowledge of the pharmacology is recommended whenever possible. On occasion, the QT effect is not a direct function of plasma concentration. For example, drugsthat cause QT prolongation as a result of changes in protein synthesis or trafficking or drugs with accumulation into myocardial tissues might demonstrate hysteresis. Testing for model assumptions, hysteresis (a plot of data by-time point and a hysteresis loop plot), and goodness of fit should be documented.\n\nConcentration-response analysis can be challenging when more than one molecular entity--multiple drugs or parent plus metabolites--contributes to the QTc effect."

The court order also enjoins FDA from implementing the language in 21 CFR SS 203.50 that requires pedigrees to include lot and control numbers, dosage, container size, and number of containers. As described in more detail below, however, the preliminary injunction does not affect the statutory requirement that pedigrees contain the dates of all listed transactions and the names and addresses of all parties involved in those transactions. In addition, since the court did not enjoin implementation of 21 CFR SS 203.3(u), a written agreement between a manufacturer and a wholesaler may limit ADR status to a particular lot number(s), dosage, or the number or size of the containers of prescription drugs. We also note that, without the lot number on the pedigree, it would be extremely difficult to track the inventory that matches the pedigree if the inventory is further sold, purchased or traded. Therefore, FDA recommends that the lot or control number, dosage, and the number and size of the prescription drug containers be included on the pedigree even though it is not required while the preliminary injunction is in effect.\n* Pedigrees for all current and future inventory are affected by the preliminary injunction as long is it remains in effect."

    "Question": "From what I've read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Will a laboratory subsequently be notified of GLP deviations not listed on the FD-483?",
    "Answer": "This does happen. The FDA investigator prepares an establishment\n\ninspection report (EIR) which summarizes the observations made at the\n\nlaboratory and which contains exhibits concerning the studies audited\n\n(Protocols, SOPs, CV's, etc.). The EIR is then reviewed by District\n\npersonnel as well as headquarters personnel. This review may reveal\n\nadditional GLP deviations that should be and are communicated to\n\nlaboratory management."

    "Answer": "It is important that a formal line of communication be established between the clinical investigator and the IRB. Clinical investigators should report adverse events directly to the responsible IRB, and should send progress reports directly to that IRB. However, FDA does not prohibit direct communication between the sponsor and the IRB, and recognizes that doing so could result in more efficient resolution of some problems. FDA does require direct communication between the sponsors and the IRBs for certain studies of medical devices and when the 21 CFR 50.24 informed consent waiver has been invoked. Sponsors and IRBs are required to communicate directly for medical device studies under 21 CFR 812.2, 812.66 and 812.150(b). For informed consent waiver studies, direct communication between sponsors and IRBs is required under 21 CFR 50.24(e), 56.109(e), 56.109(g), 56.109(g), 312.54(b), 312.130(d), 812.38(b)(4) and 812.47(b)."

    "Answer": "No. The original intent of section II.B (2.2) was to distinguish the main responsibilities (e.g., batch record review, review of nonconformances and investigations, sampling, testing, release or rejection of intermediate or API) of the independent quality unit from other departments within a company. Contract manufacturers are expected to have an independent quality unit that meets the responsibilities defined in ICH Q7, section II.B (2.2) for all activities performed. Given the potential complexity of outsourcing contract manufacturing arrangements, GMP responsibilities should be clearly defined between both parties in detail in a written agreement (ICH Q7, paragraph 16.12). However, the overall responsibility for API quality must not be delegated.6 Footnote 6: See 21 U.S.C. 351 (\u201cthe term \u2018current good manufacturing practice\u2019 includes the implementation of oversight and controls over the manufacturer of drugs to ensure quality, including managing the risk of and establishing the safety of raw materials, materials used in the manufacturing of drugs, and finished drug products.\u201d)."

    "Answer": "General references in this guidance to \u201capplications\u201d submitted or approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act also may include ANDAs, to the extent applicable. An ANDA generally must contain information to demonstrate, among other things, that the proposed generic drug has the same active ingredient(s), conditions of use, dosage form, route of administration, strength, and (with certain permissible differences) labeling as the reference listed drug (section 505(i)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act). Given the complexity of protein molecules and limitations of current analytical methods, it may be difficult for manufacturers of proposed protein products to demonstrate that the active ingredient in their proposed product is the same as the active ingredient in an already approved product, and thus ANDAs are not a focus of this guidance. There are no currently marketed bio logical products that were approved through the ANDA pathway."

    "Answer": "Yes. Sugars created through the controlled hydrolysis of starch or other complex carbohydrates in the production of plant-based beverages (e.g. beverages made from oats and rice) or other foods need to be declared as Added Sugars on the Nutrition Facts label because the sugars created through controlled hydrolysis add empty calories to the diet (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii); 81 FR 33742 at 33831 through 33832 (comment 201 and response), 33835 (comment 207 and response)).\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we explained that if a manufacturer purposely employs a hydrolysis step as part of a food manufacturing process to increase the sugar content of a food product (e.g. enzymatic hydrolysis of corn starch to make corn syrup in the same facility as part of the cookie-making process), we would consider the sugar generated from the hydrolysis step to be added sugars, because the manufacturer purposely used hydrolysis to increase the product's sugar content (81 FR 33742 at 33832)."

    "Answer": "Adjustment for baseline measurements is potentially useful for several purposes, including detection of carry-over effects, reducing the influence of inter-subject differences, and accounting for diurnal effects such as those due to food. There is no single best approach for baseline adjustment, but all planned baseline computations should be prospectively defined in the clinical trial protocol. Two kinds of baseline are commonly used: _time-matched_ baseline (taken at exactly the same time-points on the day prior to the beginning of treatment as on the treatment day) and _predose_ baseline (taken shortly prior to dosing). The _predose_ baseline is used for adjustment for inter-subject differences but not for diurnal effects. The choice of baseline is influenced by whether the study is parallel or crossover."

(3.4)",
    "Answer": "Sensitivity of the assay can be evaluated by use of appropriate positive control compounds known to have effects on ventricular repolarization (ICH S7B guideline). The selection of the positive control and its administration (e.g. negative control time-matched groups, concurrent assessment, relevance concentration or approach) should be considered to demonstrate that the study was capable of detecting QT prolonging effects if present. Other testing methods or approaches should be considered (e.g. microvolt T-wave alternans, microelectrode mapping) as adjuncts to ECG evaluations. Positive sensorimotor convulsant drugs may induce substantial changes in the QTc interval or may alter the QTc sensitivity to drugs that had no or limited effect on the QTc interval (e.g. ion channel blockers) due to altered conducting or excitability. In these cases, it is important to collect ECG data within the senior healthy range and to consider validating the study by evaluating other potential biomarkers of drug-induced proarrhythmia effects (e.g. EADs, TdP)"

    "Question": "Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Are there alternatives to obtaining informed consent from a subject?",
    "Answer": "The regulations generally require that the investigator obtain informed consent from subjects. Investigators also may obtain informed consent from a legally authorized representative of the subject. FDA recognizes that a durable power of attorney might suffice as identifying a legally authorized representative under some state and local laws. For example, a subject might have designated an individual to provide consent with regard to health care decisions through a durable power of attorney and have specified that the individual also has the power to make decisions on entry into research. FDA defers to state and local laws regarding who is a legally authorized representative. Therefore, the IRB should assure that the consent procedures comply with state and local laws, including assurance that the law applies to obtaining informed consent for subjects participating in research as well as for patients who require health care decisions.\"\n\nAlternatives 1 and 2 are provided for in the regulations and are appropriate. Alternative 3 allows a designated individual to provide consent for a patient with regard to health care decisions and is appropriate when it specifically includes entry into research.

    "Question": "Given the context of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Does FDA intend to rely on a firm's product communications that are consistent with the FDA-required labeling to establish a new intended use?",
    "Answer": "No. If a firm's product communication is consistent with the FDA-required labeling, FDA does not intend to rely on that communication to establish a new intended use, different from the use(s) for which the product is legally marketed. In addition, FDA does not intend to consider a product communication that is consistent with the FDA-required labeling as evidence of a firm's failure to comply with the FD&C Act's requirement that a medical product's labeling bear adequate directions for use (see section 502(f) of the FD&C Act) based solely on the fact that the communication presents data and information that are not reflected in the product's FDA-required labeling. This is not to suggest that these communications must be excluded from consideration altogether. For example, if there is other evidence of a new intended use for a product, product communications that are consistent with the FDA-required labeling may be part of the overall material that is evaluated in assessing the firm's conduct.\n\nEven if a firm's product communication is consistent with the FDA-required labeling, the firm also must ensure that the communication satisfies other applicable requirements. In this respect, please note that the determination of whether or not a communication is consistent with the FDA-required labeling is separate from the determination of which specific labeling or advertising provisions of the FDA authorities, if any, apply to that communication (see Q.6/A.6 and Q.7/A.7)."

    "Question": "Based on the information from E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs \n\nS7B Nonclinical Evaluation of the Potential for Delayed Ventricular Repolarization (QT Interval Prolongation) by Human Pharmaceuticals , The ICH E14 guidance describes in section** **II.C (2.3) (Clinical Trial Evaluation After the \"Thorough QT/QTc Study\") that \"adequate ECG assessment to accomplish this [monitoring] is not fully established.\" Is there now a reasonable approach to evaluating QTc in late-stage clinical development in the case of a finding of QT prolongation prior to late phase studies? (7.1)",
    "Answer": "Currently there is no definitive approach to assessing the clinical proarrhythmic potential of a drug. The evaluation of QTc prolongation in the drug development process is evolving and should be individualized to each compound based on results of prior studies, mechanistic considerations, and results of earlier clinical experience. If QTc prolongation is detected during clinical development, sponsors should adequately characterize the effects of their compounds on the QT/QTc interval in a timely manner based on the available information. Such characterization usually involves a dedicated study applying a rigorous design with assurances of quality data so that the results can be properly interpreted. The results should then be assessed in the context of other contributing factors, such as the therapeutic index, the inherent proarrhythmic risk of the target disease, potential for differential exposure, and the contribution of other QT-prolonging drugs concomitantly administered.\n\nIf QT/QTc data are available from a previous thorough QT/QTc study, interpretable QTc data from other controlled clinical studies, or from an integrated nonclinical and clinical QT/QTc risk assessment performed either before or after the finding of QTc prolongation, these data should be considered when evaluating the clinical proarrhythmic potential of the drug. Factors to consider in assessment of the clinical proarrhythmic potential include, but are not limited to, the magnitude of the QTc prolongation, the dose-response relationship, and the relationship between plasma concentrations and QTc prolongation. The sponsor should provide evidence-based rationale to support the conclusion that the QTc prolongation observed in the context of the particular study at issue does not pose an unacceptable proarrhythmic risk to subjects."

In addition, the court does not mention other pedigree-related regulations or other agency-issued documents relating to the pedigree requirement. Accordingly, those regulations and documents, some of which are described below, are not affected by the preliminary injunction.\n\n* 21 CFR SS 203.3(u).

As of December 1, 2006, only thosewholesale distributors who have an ongoing relationship (including a written agreement) with the manufacturer, as that term is defined by this regulation, are exempt from the pedigree requirement.\n* Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) 160.900, which issued in November 2006, remains in effect until December 1, 2007. The CPG describes how FDA intends to prioritize its enforcement efforts regarding the pedigree requirements in the first year after the effective date of 21 CFR SSS 203.3(u) and 203.50. However, FDA will not enforce 203.50(a) as long as the preliminary injunction remains in effect.\n* All other definitions in 21 CFR Part 203 that relate to the pedigree requirement, including but not limited to, the definitions of manufacturer and wholesale distribution, have been in effect since December 2000 and remain in effect despite the injunction.\n* The names and addresses of all parties to the transaction and the date of the transactions are required by the statute and must be included in the pedigree.\n* 21 CFR SS 203.50(b). This regulation, which went into effect on December 1, 2006, requires all wholesale distributors (both ADRs and non-ADRs) involved in the distribution of a prescription drug to retain a copy of the pedigree for three years. Accordingly, all wholesale distributors that provide or receive pedigrees after December 1, 2006, must retain copies of the pedigrees for three years.\n* 21 CFR SS 203.50(c). This regulation, which also went into effect on December 1, 2006, provides that a manufacturer that subjects a drug to additional manufacturing processes is not required to provide a pedigree identifying previous sales of the drug or its components.\n* 21 CFR SS 203.50(d). This regulation also went into effect on December 1, 2006, and requires manufacturers to maintain a current written list of all ADRs, to specify whether each ADR is authorized to distribute all of the manufacturer's drug products or only particular products, to update its list of ADRs on a continuing basis, and to make its list of ADRs available for public inspection or copying. Accordingly, as of December 1, 2006, all manufacturers should have available for public inspection a current list of ADRs that indicates which drug products the ADR is authorized to distribute.\n* 21 CFR SS 203.60. This regulation sets forth certain requirements with respect to the use of electronic records and signatures, record retention, and the availability of records for review and reproduction by FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory and law enforcement officials.

    "Question": "Guideline title: M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals  Why is an MFD treated like an MTD in Approaches 3 and 5 when considering the maximum clinical exposure in the exploratory clinical trial? If no toxicity is observed in either species when using an MFD, shouldn't this be treated similarly to the case in Approach 4 when there is no toxicity in either species (i.e., limit the clinical exposure to 1/10th rather than I/2 the exposure at the highest dose tested)?",
    "Answer": "In any situation in which the MFD is used as the top dose for a toxicity study, it is simply not possible to test a higher dose/exposure. If the top dose used is the MFD and no toxicity is observed, this situation is similar to that of the limit dose when toxicity has not been identified (i.e., the limit dose is the NOAEL) where clinical exposures up to 1/2 the AUC at the NOAEL can be used (see section I.E(1.5) of the M3(R2) guidance, and section II.A (1) of this Q&A guidance, Limit Dose for Toxicity Studies, Q&A9). The 1/10th exposure limit is not applied when the high dose is limited by an MFD, because this could prevent adequate clinical testing of a drug under the exploratory clinical trial concept. When no toxicity is identified using Approach 4, a more stringent safety limit has been recommended because it would have been possible to test higher doses in animals to characterize the toxicity profile of the drug."

(8.5)",
    "Answer": "No. Batch data alone demonstrating that a mutagenic impurity is consistently less than 30 percent TTC or AI is not sufficient to apply an Option 4 control strategy.\n\nHowever, if there is negligible risk of the impurity to be present in the drug substance, an Option 4 control strategy may be considered with appropriate justification.

As identified in the 2013 RBM guidance, for investigations that include blinding of interventions and/or outcome assessments, ensuring that the blinding of the investigation is maintained is a critical process that sponsors should consider in their risk assessment.\n\nSpecific risks to the maintenance of the blinding that are identified during the risk assessment should be mitigated in advance of investigation initiation, when feasible. In addition, identifying and tracking deviations during the conduct of the investigation that could result in unintentional unblinding of treatment assignment should be considered as a part of the monitoring plan, to ensure that appropriate blinding is maintained at clinical sites and by the sponsor, organizations such as contract research organizations and other vendors. For example, in a blinded investigation that requires the site staff personnel dispensing the test article to know whether the test article is the investigational product or the placebo, the adequacy of maintaining the blinding for the remainder of the site staff should be monitored.\n\nFDA recognizes that Data Monitoring Committees (DMC) may access unblinded data as described in the DMC Charter.

    "Question": "After reviewing Medical Device Reporting for Manufacturers Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What additional considerations apply to communications to payors about unapproved products and about unapproved uses of approved/cleared/licensed products?",
    "Answer": "Firms' communications regarding unapproved products and unapproved uses of approved/cleared/licensed medical products raise a number of potentially competing public health interests. FDA's approach to implementation of its authorities in this area seeks to balance these interests to best advance the public health overall.\n\nSome firm communications regarding unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved/cleared/licensed medical products may potentially undermine substantial government interests related to health and safety. These interests include motivating the development of robust scientific data on safety and efficacy; maintaining the premarket review process for safety and efficacy of each intended use in order to prevent harm, to protect against fraud, misrepresentation, and bias, and to develop appropriate instructions for use for medical products; protecting the integrity and reliability of promotional information regarding medical product uses; and preventing the diversion of health care resources toward ineffective treatments.\n\nFDA recognizes that there can be, in certain instances, tension between the public health interests directly advanced by the premarket review requirements and other important interests. For example, as discussed in section II of this guidance, FDA recognizes that payors, in some situations, need to plan for and make coverage and reimbursement decisions for medical products and uses far in advance of the effective date of such decisions. As a result, FDA recognizes the value of payors receiving unbiased, factual, accurate, and non-misleading information of the type described in Q.C.1/A.C.1 about unapproved products and unapproved uses of approved/cleared/licensed medical products in order to inform their decision-making.\n\nFDA believes that the categories of information described in Q.C.1/A.C.1 are, on the one hand, broad enough to encompass the information that payors may need to make informed coverage and reimbursement decisions and, on the other hand, limited enough to maintain appropriate incentives for firms to conduct robust studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of unapproved products and unapproved uses of approved/cleared/licensed medical products. In addition, if firms follow the recommendations in Q.C.1/A.C.1 and provide unbiased, factual, accurate, and non-misleading information, FDA believes that the risk that payors will be misled is relatively low. Payors are a sophisticated audience with established procedures to carefully consider the full range of relevant evidence about new uses of medical products. Payors possess financial resources and motivation to closely scrutinize information from firms. In making decisions on a population basis, payors can draw on a range of expertise in multiple disciplines that allows them to critically evaluate information presented to them by firms, including an evaluation of the limitations and reliability of that information.\n\nThus, FDA believes the recommendations provided in this section of the guidance appropriately balance the competing interests described above for firms' communications with payor audiences about unapproved products and unapproved uses of approved/cleared/licensed products. Firms' communications to other audiences about unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved/cleared/licensed products could raise additional or different considerations and are beyond the scope of this guidance.59\n\nFootnote 59: The Agency has issued other guidance documents that could apply to firms\u2019 communications to other audiences. For example, FDA has issued a draft guidance for industry describing its thinking on how firms can respond to unsolicited requests for unapproved use information related to their FDA-approved prescription drugs and FDA-approved or cleared medical devices. See FDA\u2019s draft guidance for industry _Responding to Unsolicited Requests for Off-Label Information About Prescription Drugs and Medical Devices_. In addition, FDA has provided separate guidances describing recommended practices for the dissemination by firms of scientific and medical publications discussing unapproved uses of approved drugs or approved or cleared medical devices. See FDA\u2019s guidance for industry _Good Reprint Practices for the Distribution of Medical Journal Articles and Medical or Scientific Reference Publications on Unapproved New Uses of Approved Drugs and Approved or Cleared Medical Devices_, and FDA\u2019s revised draft guidance _Distributing Scientific and Medical Publications on Unapproved New Uses \u2013 Recommended Practices_."

    "Question": "Taking into account the content of Distribution of In Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only or Investigational Use Only Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Are some ASRs Class II or Class III, requiring a premarket submission?",
    "Answer": "Yes. Although most ASRs are Class I, there are some ASRs that are Class II and Class III and that must be cleared or approved by FDA before they can be marketed in the United States. 21 CFR 864.4020. FDA classifies medical devices, including diagnostic devices such as ASRs, into Class I, II, or III according to the level of regulatory control that is necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. These classifications include consideration of the level of risk associated with the device. 21 U.S.C. 360c. The classification of an ASR determines the appropriate premarket process.\n\nAn ASR is a Class II device if the reagent is used as a component in a blood banking test of a type that has been classified as a Class II device (e.g., certain cytomegalovirus serological and treponema pallidum nontreponemal test reagents). 21 CFR 864.4020(b)(2).\n\nAn ASR is a Class III device if the reagent is intended as a component in tests intended either:\n\n* to diagnose a contagious condition that is highly likely to result in a fatal outcome and prompt, accurate diagnosis offers the opportunity to mitigate the public health impact of the condition (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus (HIV/AIDS) or tuberculosis (TB)); or\n* for use in donor screening for conditions for which FDA has recommended or required testing in order to safeguard the blood supply or establish the safe use of blood and blood products (e.g., tests for hepatitis or for identifying blood groups). 21 CFR 864.4020(b)(3).\n\nFDA considers ASRs intended to be used as a component in tests for diagnosis of HIV (including monitoring for viral load or HIV drug resistance mutations) to be Class III ASRs."

    "Answer": "The ASR rule was designed to accomplish several policy objectives. One of the primary goals of the rule was to ensure the quality of the primary, active reagents of finished IVDs or LDTs. Another focus of the rule is the requirement for appropriate labeling to be appended to test results when ASRs are used by clinical laboratories in LDTs, so that healthcare users can understand when tests are being developed and validated by the laboratory and have not undergone FDA clearance or approval. 62 FR 62244. FDA adopted the approach of regulating most ASRs by means of general controls and exempting them from premarket notification requirements as the least burdensome approach. This approach relies primarily on cGMPs, medical device reporting, and labeling requirements to adequately control the risks associated with these devices. In addition, laboratories that develop tests using ASRs must be in compliance with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. 263a 62 FR 62252."

    "Answer": "Section 510(a)(2)(B) of the Act requires that all drugs be manufactured, processed, packed, and held in accordance with CGMPs. No distinction is made between the manufacture of drug substance and drug product. Although the CGMP regulations under 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211 apply only to drug products, FDA expects appropriate CGMPs to be applied to all steps of a drug substance manufacturing process beginning with the use of starting materials. The types of sites identified in the guidance are routinely subject to FDA inspection with the exception of those facilities or establishments used to manufacture or process drug substance intermediates. Drug substance intermediate manufacturing or processing sites are not exempt from inspection, but an inspection is generally discretionary. Moreover, this type of facility is always subject to _for cause_ inspection. Because drug substance intermediate sites are not routinely inspected, a satisfactory CGMP inspection was not included as a condition for submitting the change in a Supplement -- Changes Being Effected in 30 Days or annual report.

    "Question": "Given the context of Treatment Use of Investigational Drugs Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, The regulations in 21 CFR 312.315(d)(iii) state that as enrollment in an intermediate-size patient population expanded access IND or protocol increases, FDA may ask the sponsor to submit an IND or protocol for the use under 312.320 (i.e., to transition the intermediate-size patient population expanded access IND or protocol to a treatment expanded access IND or protocol). When and how would FDA make such a determination and how would such a transition be carried out?\n\n",
    "Answer": "FDA anticipates that there would ordinarily be a seamless transition from intermediate-size patient population expanded access to expanded access under a treatment IND or protocol at the point when the evidence is sufficient to support the treatment IND or protocol, when there is adequate progress with drug development, and when the sponsor is willing to make the drug available to a potentially larger patient population under a treatment IND or protocol. Although there will be a 30-day period for initiation of the new treatment IND or protocol, as required by the regulations, the review division can act sooner and FDA may notify the sponsor that treatment may begin earlier (21 CFR 312.40 and 312.305(d)(1)).\n\nFor such a transition, all patients currently receiving treatment with the investigational drug would continue treatment under the intermediate-size patient population expanded access IND or protocol until they transition to the treatment IND or protocol (to ensure that treatment is not interrupted). Once all patients in the intermediate-size patient population expanded access IND or protocol are receiving their treatment under the new treatment IND or protocol, the intermediate-size patient population expanded access IND or protocol will be terminated."

    "Question": "This question is about Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators A fill-in-the-blank format provides only some standard wording and a framework for organizing the relevant study information. The IRB should review a completed sample form, individualized for each study, to ensure that the consent document, in its entirety, contains all the information required by 21 CFR 50.25 in language the subject can understand. The completed sample form should be typed to enhance its readability by the subjects. The form finally approved by the IRB should be an exact copy of the form that will be presented to the research subjects. The IRB should also review the \"process\" for conducting the consent interviews, i.e., the circumstances under which consent will be obtained, who will obtain consent, and so forth.",
    "Answer": "Yes. FDA does not require any subject to \"waive\" a legal right. Rather, FDA requires that subjects be informed that complete privacy does not apply in the context of research involving FDA regulated products. Under the authority of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, FDA may inspect and copy clinical records to verify information submitted by a sponsor. FDA generally will not copy a subject's name during the inspection unless a more detailed study of the case is required or there is reason to believe that the records do not represent the actual cases studied or results obtained. The consent document should not state or imply that FDA needs clearance or permission from the clinical investigator, the subject or the IRB for such access. When clinical investigators conduct studies for submission to FDA, they agree to allow FDA access to the study records, as outlined in 21 CFR 312.68 and 812.145. Informed consent documents should make it clear that, by participating in research, the subject's records automatically become part of the research database. Subjects do not have the option to keep their records from being audited/reviewed by FDA. When an individually identifiable medical record (usually kept by the clinical investigator, not by the IRB) is copied and reviewed by the Agency, proper confidentiality procedures are followed within FDA. Consistent with laws relating to public disclosure of information and the law enforcement responsibilities of the Agency, however, absolute confidentiality cannot be guaranteed."

Some examples of risk factors for introduction of elemental impurities into the drug product include the use of a catalyst or inorganic reagent in the manufacture of a component or the drug product, and the use of high concentrations of inorganic components, including mined materials, in the drug product formulation. See ICH Q3D for more information on performing risk assessments.

In such cases, what other methods should be used for evaluation of QT/QTc and proarrhythmic potential? (6.1)",
    "Answer": "An integrated nonclinical and clinical QT/QTc risk assessment can be particularly valuable when a thorough QT study or concentration-QTc analysis meeting similar quality control as needed for a dedicated study as described in E14 Q&A Q12 (5.1) is not feasible. This situation can arise under scenarios where a placebo-controlled comparison is not possible; safety considerations preclude administering supratherapeutic doses to obtain high clinical exposures and/or safety or tolerability prohibit the use of the product in healthy participants. The design elements that include placebo and healthy participant dosing assist in decreasing variability, but their absence does not preclude interpretation._\n\n_The integrated nonclinical and clinical QT/QTc risk assessment should include:_\n\n1. _The hERG assay, an in vivo QT assay, and any follow-up nonclinical studies, especially those selected to overcome the challenges encountered in the clinical studies (see ICH S7B Q&As Q17 (1.1) and Q18 (1.2)_\n2. _Alternative QT clinical study designs incorporating ECG assessments with as many of the usual \"thorough QT/QTc\" design features as possible (see ICH E14 guidance, section II.B (2.2), and E14 Q&A Q12 (5.1))_\n\n_In situations where it is not possible to evaluate the QT/QTc effects at high clinical exposure, it is particularly important that the nonclinical in vivo studies are conducted at exposures covering the high clinical exposure (see ICH E14 Q&A Q12 (5.1) for definition of high clinical exposure)._\n\n_An integrated QT/QTc risk assessment can also be particularly valuable for drugs with confounding heart rate effects that could impact accurate determination of the QTc. Advanced methodologies for controlling (e.g., pacing) or correcting for heart rate changes in the nonclinical in vivo studies and/or conducting QTc assessments in the intended patient population might be informative in this situation. If tolerance to the chronotropic effect develops with repeat dosing, upward titration regimens can sometimes be employed to avoid or minimize the confounding effects of drug-induced heart rate changes on the QTc assessment."

    "Answer": "Yes. If space permits, FDA recommends the 2D data matrix barcode be affixed or imprinted near or next to elements of the human-readable portion of the product identifier on a package (see Question and Answer #4 above). FDA believes this placement would help downstream trading partners (repackagers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers) associate the information encoded in the 2D data matrix barcode with the human-readable information. We are aware that some trading partners may utilize the 2D data matrix barcode to electronically read or retrieve the encoded information for reasons such as data entry for inventory purposes, patient medical records, or product verification.

    "Question": "Referring to Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, What is a master file and how is one submitted?",
    "Answer": "A device master file (MAF) is a reference source that a person submits to FDA. In general, it is a file of trade secret or confidential commercial/financial information submitted by a third party (i.e., someone other than the applicant) for use as a reference source in support of at least one application. FDA will accept MAFs from organizations or persons who have not submitted or will not directly submit the information in a PMA, IDE, 510(k), or other device-related submission to FDA. MAFs may include information on the following:\n\n* facilities and manufacturing procedures and controls;\n* synthesis, formulation, purification and specifications for chemicals, materials (an alloy, plastic, etc.) or subassemblies for a device;\n* packaging materials;\n* contract packaging and other manufacturing (such as sterilization);\n* nonclinical study data; and\n* clinical study data.\n\nWe recommend that a MAF include a cover letter, preferably on company letterhead, signed by a responsible company official that identifies the submission as a MAF and provides the name of a contact person at the company or a designated agent.

    "Answer": "The use of a double-blinded positive control does not appear to be essential, provided that the reading of ECGs is performed in a blinded manner as described in Question Q2 (1.2), and the study is carefully designed to ensure that specified study procedures are followed uniformly. This means that the same protocol for administering the test drug and placebo, taking blood samples, and collecting the ECG data should also be used when giving the positive control. This does not mean that other aspects of the study, such as the duration of treatment with the positive control and the other treatment groups, would be identical. If blinding of the positive control is performed, common methods include the use of double-dummy techniques and over-encapsulation."

    "Question": "In light of the details from E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , The ICH E14 guidance states that QT interval corrected by Fridericia's and Bazett's correction should be submitted in all applications; is this still necessary? Is there a recommended approach to QT correction that is different from that specified in ICH E14? (1.5)",
    "Answer": "Changes in heart rate could variably influence a drug's effect on repolarization (i.e., QT interval), and correction methods with different characteristics are often applied. The principles set below would be applicable in all clinical studies (thorough QT or other studies).\n\nIn adults, Bazett's correction has been clearly shown to be an inferior method of correcting for differences in heart rate among and within subjects. Therefore, QT interval data corrected using Bazett's corrections is no longer warranted in all applications unless there is a compelling reason for a comparison to historical Bazett's corrected QT data. Presentation of data with a Fridericia's correction is likely to be appropriate in most situations, but other methods could be more appropriate. There is no single recommended alternative (see Question Q4 (1.4) on Incorporating New Technologies), but the following are some considerations:\n\n1. Analyses of the same data using different models for correcting QT can generate discordant results. Therefore, it is important that the method(s) of correction, criteria for the selection of the method of correction, and rationale for the components of the method of correction be specified prior to analysis to limit bias. Model selection should be based on objective criteria and should consider the uncertainty in parameter estimates. Alternative methods of correction should be used only if the primary method fails the pre-specified criteria for selection of the method of correction.\n2. Corrections that are individualized to a subject's unique heart rate QT dynamic are not likely to work well when the data are sparse or when the baseline data upon which the correction is based do not cover at least the heart rate range observed in patients on the study drug."

    "Answer": "If there has been previous clinical experience with the two entities used together, a combination toxicity study would generally not be recommended for an increase in dose/exposure of one of the entities unless this gave cause for significant toxicological concern. The level of concern would depend on the new exposure margins, the established safety profile of the individual agents, the degree of experience with the co-administration, and the ability to monitor any potential adverse effects in humans. If the increase in dose/exposure does cause concern and a study is conducted to address that concern, then it should generally be completed before carrying out clinical studies with the combination.

    "Question": "With reference to E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs \n\nS7B Nonclinical Evaluation of the Potential for Delayed Ventricular Repolarization (QT Interval Prolongation) by Human Pharmaceuticals , What is the recommended method to compute the hERG safety margin? (1.2)",
    "Answer": "A drug's potency for hERG block, usually calculated as half-inhibitory concentration (IC50), can be normalized to the drug's estimated clinically relevant exposures in patients to calculate the safety margin. As more information is obtained during the clinical development, the estimated values of clinical exposures can be refined. When estimating hERG block potency, it is recommended to use standardized procedures and to consider the principles described in S7B Q&A Q19 (2.1).\n\nThe free drug exposure is computed based on the drug's total plasma concentration and the fraction of protein binding. Because of uncertainties in the protein binding measurements, the unbound (free) fraction in plasma should be set to 1% if experimentally determined to be \\(<1\\%\\). This approach has been used in the regulatory assessment for the risk of drug- drug interactions. If protein binding values cannot be accurately assessed (e.g., questionable validation of the bioanalytical method, deviations from best practices), safety margins should be calculated for both steady-state free and total C\\({}_{\\text{max}}\\).\n\nIn terms of the exposure to use in the denominator of the safety margin calculation for supporting decision-making under ICH E14 Q&As Q12 (5.1) or Q13 (6.1), it is generally recommended that the high clinical exposure be used as defined in ICH E14 Q&A Q12 (5.1) (i.e., mean steady-state maximum concentration (C\\({}_{\\text{max,ss}}\\)) when the maximum therapeutic dose is administered in the presence of the intrinsic or extrinsic factor that has the largest effect on increasing C\\({}_{\\text{max,ss}}\\)).\n\nTo assess whether the hERG block poses a risk of delaying ventricular repolarization or TdP, the resulting safety margin should be compared to the range of safety margins computed under the same experimental protocol for a series of reference drugs that have known clinical TdP risk and cover diverse electrophysiological properties. Additional pharmacological principles or modeling can be used to justify the use of a certain safety margin threshold (e.g., relationshipbetween hERG block and QTc prolongation from semi-mechanistic\n\npharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models or systems pharmacology models; see Leishman et al. 2020,7 for examples). This should be supported by experimental data based on the principles in these S7B Q&As (e.g., same experimental protocol applied to a series of drugs with known clinical TdP risk).\n\nFootnote 7: DJ Leishman, MM Abernathy, and EB Wang, 2020, Revisiting the HERG Safety Margin After 20 Years of Routine hERG Scrrening, Journal of Pharmacological and Toxicological Methods, 105:106900 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vascn.2020.106900).\n\nData supporting the safety margin threshold to define a drug as having low TdP risk should be supplied in or appended to the submitted study report. If a recommended hERG margin threshold is published based on principles in these S7B Q&As, a sponsor (or a contract laboratory) seeking to use the same threshold should demonstrate that the inter-laboratory variability of IC50s from a set of calibration drugs under the same experimental protocol does not significantly decrease the sensitivity of the safety margin threshold for detecting drugs that are not low risk for TdP. Appropriate statistical methods should be applied to quantify experimental IC50 variability and calculate uncertainty of the safety margin as confidence/credible intervals."

    "Question": "This question is about Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry  Is a pediatric assessment under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) required for a proposed biosimilar product? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]",
    "Answer": "Under PREA (codified at section 505B of the FD&C Act), all applications for new active ingredients, new indications, new dosage forms, new dosing regimens, or new routes of administration are required to contain a pediatric assessment to support dosing and administration, safety, and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indication unless this requirement is waived, deferred, or inapplicable.9 Under section 505B(l) of the FD&C Act,10 a biosimilar product that has not been determined to be interchangeable with the reference product is considered to have a \"new active ingredient\" for purposes of PREA, and a pediatric assessment is generally required unless waived or deferred or inapplicable. Under the statute, an interchangeable product is not considered to have a new active ingredient for purposes of PREA. However, if an applicant first seeks licensure of its proposed product as a biosimilar product, the applicant must address applicable PREA requirements for its noninterchangeable biosimilar product even if it ultimately intends to seek licensure of the product as an interchangeable product. See Q&A I.16 of this guidance for information on how a proposed biosimilar product applicant may fulfill the requirement for pediatric assessments under PREA. FDA encourages prospective biosimilar applicants to submit plans for pediatric studies as early as practicable during product development. If there is no active investigational new drug (IND) application for the proposed biosimilar product and the sponsor intends to conduct a comparative clinical study as part of its development program, the initial pediatric study plan (PSP) should be submitted as a pre-IND submission. In this scenario, FDA encourages the sponsor to meet with FDA before submission of the initial PSP to discuss the details of the planned development program. A sponsor should submit the initial PSP before initiating any comparative clinical study in its biosimilar development program. For more information, see Q&A I.17 of this guidance. See also the guidance for industry _Pediatric Study Plans: Content of and Process for Submitting Initial Pediatric Study Plans and Amended Initial Pediatric Study Plans_ (July 2020)."

    "Answer": "Approach 3 involves just a single dose in humans supported by extended single-dose toxicity studies in rodents and nonrodents conducted up to the animal maximum tolerated dose (MTD), maximum feasible dose (MFD), or limit dose. Approach 4 involves multi-dose clinical trials (up to 14 days) supported by 14-day toxicity studies (in rodents and nonrodents) in which dose selection for animals is based on multiples of proposed human exposure in the exploratory clinical trial. If no toxicity is observed in either species, it is recommended that the maximum clinical dose not exceed 1/10th the lower exposure (AUC) in either species at the highest dose tested in the animals. If toxicity is observed, see answer \\(A2b\\) below.\n\nApproach 5 involves multi-dose clinical trials (up to 14 days) supported by a 14-day study in rodents up to the MTD, MFD, or limit dose and a nonrodent _confirmatory_ study (at least equivalent to the duration of the exploratory clinical trial) that indicates that the nonrodent is not more sensitive than the rodent. In this case, the highest exposure appropriate in the exploratory clinical trial should be determined by the findings in the toxicity studies.\n\nThus, the differences between Approach 4 and Approach 5 include how the standard nonclinical toxicity study recommendations are modified, and how the clinical exposure limit is established. Approach 5 probably uses less drug than Approach 4, but relies heavily on the rodent for identifying safety risks. Approach 4 gives equal weight to the rodent and nonrodent, but might not identify target organ toxicity in either species. In this case, clinical progression is supported by the knowledge that a reasonable safety margin exists.\n\nThe series of examples are intended to provide sponsors flexibility in exploratory clinical trial approaches so that they can do what best fits their purpose. The approaches given are only examples, and sponsors can propose alternatives that do not fit neatly into one of the described approaches."

    "Answer": "No. The ICH Q11 general principles for selection of starting materials do not include a recommendation that all steps involving mutagenic reagents or impurities should be included in the process description in section 3.2.S.2.2. Similarly, the general principles do not include a recommendation that all steps that establish regio- or stereochemical configurations (which can therefore result in regio- or stereoisomerism) should be included in section 3.2.S.2.2. However, it is expected that the other ICH Q11 general principles on impurities (see Q&As 5.7, 5.8 and 5.9) and inclusion of enough of the manufacturing process (see Q&A 5.11) be applied when deciding whether steps that involve mutagenic reagents, impurities, or establish regio- or stereochemical configurations, need to be included. As an example, a mutagenic compound could be introduced prior to the starting material, or be the starting material itself, provided the ICH Q11 general principles are addressed."

    "Question": "This question is about Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff What evidentiary support should a firm have for its CFL promotional communications?",
    "Answer": "Under the FD&C Act and FDA's implementing regulations, labeling for drugs and devices and advertising for prescription drugs and restricted devices must be truthful and non-misleading, which includes revealing facts that are material about the product being promoted, including information about the risks of the product.20 When these communications lack appropriate evidentiary support, they are likely to be false or misleading and can cause patient harm. To be truthful and non-misleading, representations or suggestions made by firms about their products need to be grounded in fact and science and presented with appropriate context. Any data, studies, or analyses relied on should be scientifically appropriate and statistically sound to support the representations or suggestions made in a CFL promotional communication.\n\nThe safety and effectiveness of the drug or device under the conditions of use in the FDA-required labeling have already been established by appropriate evidence during the premarket review process (and/or through the device classification process). Therefore, FDA would not consider representations or suggestions in a CFL promotional communication to be false or misleading based only on the lack of evidence sufficient to satisfy the applicable approval/clearance standard. For example, evidence other than that which meets the new drug approval standard of \"substantial evidence\" of effectiveness could be used to support certain representations or suggestions about a prescription drug in a CFL promotional communication.21 Nevertheless, the communication could be false or misleading for other reasons. Accordingly, the representations or suggestions should be supported and presented as described in this guidance.\n\nFootnote 21: In such circumstances, FDA does not intend to interpret its regulations, see, for example, 21 CFR 202.1(e)(6)(i), to the contrary.\n\nThe amount and type of evidence needed to support a particular CFL promotional communication depends in part on the topic addressed by the communication. For example, different evidence would be needed to support a long-term efficacy presentation than would be needed to support a presentation about a product's mechanism of action. The amount and type of evidence needed also depends on the particular representations or suggestions that are made about any given topic in the communication. We are aware that firms are interested in including information from a variety of types of studies and analyses in their product communications, including additional information from the studies that supported approval or clearance of their product and from postmarket studies and analyses of their product. As a general matter, FDA believes that a variety of types of studies and analyses can provide useful additional information about a medical product for its approved/cleared conditions of use. However, some of these studies or analyses do not, in and of themselves, allow for reliable conclusions to be drawn about the effects of the product. To be considered truthful and non-misleading, firms' product communications should not overstate the findings of or the conclusions that can be drawn from such studies or analyses, or fail to disclose their material limitations.\n\nFor example, certain analyses of pivotal trial data may provide information that elaborates on the data reflected in the product's FDA-required labeling and could add to understanding of a product (e.g., information from separate analyses of the individual components of a composite endpoint that was successfully used as the primary endpoint and that are derived from appropriate statistical tests22 and pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan). However, if the pivotal trial was, for example, not adequately powered to determine treatment effect on the individual components of the composite endpoint and/or type 1 error (false positive rate) was not controlled in these analyses, these analyses would generally not support conclusions about a treatment effect of the product on the individual components of the composite endpoint. In such a case, representing or suggesting that the data support such efficacy conclusions, either directly (e.g., by claiming the product has demonstrated efficacy on the individual components) or indirectly (e.g., by presenting p-values, which would imply a statistically rigorous conclusion where one does not exist), would be false or misleading.\n\nFootnote 22: See, for example, FDA\u2019s guidance _E9 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials_ (September 1998); FDA\u2019s guidance _Design Considerations for Pivotal Clinical Investigations for Medical Devices_ (November 2013); and FDA\u2019s guidance _Statistical Guidance on Reporting Results from Studies Evaluating Diagnostic Tests_ (March 2007)."

    "Question": "In light of the details from Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , Can a proposed biosimilar product have a formulation that is different from the reference product? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]",
    "Answer": "Differences between the formulation of a proposed biosimilar product and the reference product may be acceptable. A 351(k) application must contain information demonstrating that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components. In addition, an applicant would need to demonstrate that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. It may be possible, for example, for a proposed biosimilar product formulated without human serum albumin to demonstrate biosimilarity to a reference product formulated with human serum albumin. For more information about FDA's current thinking on the interpretation of the statutory standard for biosimilarity, see FDA's guidance for industry _Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product_, and draft guidance for industry _Development of Therapeutic Protein Biosimilars: Comparative Analytical Assessment and Other Quality-Related Considerations.4 Footnote 4: This draft guidance, when finalized, will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic."

    "Question": "According to the Guidance for Industry | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk What are the expectations for evaluation of the mutagenic potential for an impurity where the amount of impurity is less than or equal to 1 milligram (mg) daily dose? (1.2)",
    "Answer": "In the context of ICH M7(R2), (quantitative) structure-activity relationships ((Q)SARs) are considered an appropriate initial evaluation of mutagenic potential of an impurity at a daily dose of less than or equal to 1 mg. When a structural alert is identified, a follow-up in vitro evaluation (e.g., bacterial reverse mutation assay) could be conducted, or the impurity could be controlled by threshold of toxicological concern (TTC). Negative results in either evaluation would classify the impurity under Class 5. The result of the bacterial reverse mutation assay overrules the (Q)SAR prediction.\n\nAdditionally, impurities should not be assigned to Class 5 based solely on the absence of structural alerts by visual evaluation alone. There is an expectation that structural alert assessment will be conducted using (Q)SAR prediction."

    "Question": "Looking at the guidelines in Guidance for Industry- Food Allergen Labeling Exemption Petitions and Notifications , Is there a penalty for failure to comply with the food allergen labeling requirements under section 403(w) of the FD&C Act?",
    "Answer": "Yes. FDA can carry out a number of regulatory actions if a food label fails to comply with the food allergen labeling requirements under the FD&C Act. Such products are misbranded and subject to enforcement actions such as recalls, import refusal, and seizure by FDA. Food facilities making such food may be issued warning letters or put on FDA's import alerts. When there is a problem that justifies a recall, firms generally recall such food products from the marketplace voluntarily."

    "Question": "Referring to Reviewer Guidance, Validation of Chromatographic Methods , What are internal standards in analytical chemistry, and why are they used in bioanalysis?",
    "Answer": "In analytical chemistry, ISs are usually a structural analog or stable isotope of an analyte of interest and are commonly used in chromatographic analytical methods to correct for variability in sample processing and analysis. In chromatographic bioanalysis, an IS is added to all samples, including calibration standards (Cals), quality controls (QCs), and subject samples prior to extraction. The specific IS selected for a method should have similar physicochemical properties to the analyte of interest so that it behaves in a similar fashion to the analyte and reflects any changes to the analyte measurement that may occur during sample processing and analysis."

    "Question": "Referring to E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , In certain cases, what other methods should be used for evaluation of QT/QTc and proarrhythmic potential?",
    "Answer": "In certain cases, the conventional \"thorough QT/QTc\" study design (a crossover study in healthy volunteers with short-term administration of the usual maximum dose and one higher dose with placebo and positive control) might need to be modified for a drug or active metabolite with a long half-life or delayed QT effect, or because of safety, tolerability, or practical issues that preclude use in healthy subjects. In most cases, alternative designs can be used that may affect power considerations, but do not compromise study interpretation. For example, multiple doses can be studied in a parallel design trial or can use patients with the disease for which the drug is intended rather than healthy volunteers."

    "Answer": "Lab scale experiments are typically sufficient when generating measured purge factors or when defining in-process control points. These studies should employ conditions representative of the final process as described in the application and should consider the potential impact of scale and equipment-related differences between the laboratory and production environment (e.g., the effects of mixing on impurity levels in heterogeneous systems, the quality of liquid-liquid phase separations). In the case of observed scale dependencies, confirmatory testing on batches manufactured at pilot or commercial scale may be advisable. There is no expectation to perform spiking studies at pilot or commercial scale."

    "Question": "Looking at the guidelines in Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can a human specimen that was initially collected in a study with the informed consent of the subject be used in a later study without a new consent process?",
    "Answer": "If the original informed consent document contains a statement that excess specimen(s) will be stored for future use in specified types of studies and the new study meets the criteria stated in that consent document, it is possible that no further consent is necessary. This assumes that the original informed consent document contains all of the other essential elements, including notice to the subject that FDA may review their files and an explanation of the purposes and benefits of the research. (See 21 CFR 50.25.) We recommend sponsors and investigators consult with the IRB regarding the need for a new informed consent process in such a case. The IRB decision should include consideration of any state and/or local requirements regarding informed consent and patient rights. If new testing could expose the subject to previously unanticipated risks (e.g., privacy concerns for the subject and/or his family related to testing for a genetic marker), a new consent may be needed. In addition, if the original informed consent did not address future research use at all, or did not cover the type of study now under consideration, it is likely a new consent will be needed.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, for human specimens leftover from specimens originally collected for a previous study, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion regarding informed consent requirements. See \"Guidance for Industry, Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Food and Drug Administration: Guidance on Informed Consent for In Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies using Leftover Human Specimens that are not Individually Identifiable,\" http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo\n\ncuments/ucm078384.htm."

(4.2)",
    "Answer": "Adjustment for baseline measurements is potentially useful for several purposes, including detection of carry-over effects, reducing the influence of inter-subject differences, and accounting for diurnal effects such as those due to food. There is no single best approach for baseline adjustment, but all planned baseline computations should be prospectively defined in the clinical trial protocol. Two kinds of baseline are commonly used: _time-matched_ baseline (taken at exactly the same time-points on the day prior to the beginning of treatment as on the treatment day) and _predose_ baseline (taken shortly prior to dosing). The _predose_ baseline is usedfor adjustment for inter-subject differences but not for diurnal effects. The choice of baseline is influenced by whether the study is parallel or crossover.\n\nFor a parallel-group study, a time-matched baseline allows the detection of differences in diurnal patterns between subjects that would not be detected by a predose baseline. In a parallel study, a _time-matched_ baseline day, if performed, would ideally occur on the day before the start of the study.\n\nIn contrast, in a crossover study, a time-matched baseline is usually not necessary because adjustments for subject- and study-specific diurnal variation are implicit by design in the assessment of time-matched drug-placebo differences in QT/QTc effect. The _predose_ baseline, therefore, is usually adequate for crossover studies.\n\nObtaining replicate ECG measurements (for example, the average of the parameters from about 3 ECGs) within several minutes of each nominal time point at baseline and at subsequent times will increase the precision of the estimated changes in QT/QTc effect."

Biotechnology-derived products include a wide variety of molecular structures and targets (e.g., peptides, polypeptides, therapeutic proteins, and monoclonal antibodies). The designs of the exploratory clinical trial and supporting toxicity studies for biotechnology-derived products should reflect their special features as described in ICH S6(R1). This includes the duration of exposure, the potential for immunogenicity in animals or humans, and the possibility that dose-limiting toxicity might be due to on-target, pharmacodynamic-related mechanisms.

    "Answer": "Certain CMC requirements and recommendations applicable to biological products regulated under the PHS Act may differ in some respects from CMC requirements and recommendations applicable to biological products regulated under the FD&C Act. However, FDA expects that in many instances the practical implications of such differences on holders of deemed BLAs will be minimal because the CMC requirements under both the PHS Act and the FD&C Act address many of the same types of CMC considerations for ensuring quality biological products. For example, FDA anticipates that most biological products subject to the transition provision, upon being deemed BLAs, will meet the related general BLA requirements (e.g., potency, sterility, purity, and identity) under the PHS Act based on the products having been previously approved under the FD&C Act."

    "Question": "In accordance with Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Which IRB members should be considered to be scientists and non-scientists?",
    "Answer": "21 CFR 56.107(c) requires at least one member of the IRB to have primary concerns in the scientific area and at least one to have primary concerns in the non-scientific area. Most IRBs include physicians and Ph.D. level physical or biological scientists. Such members satisfy the requirement for at least one scientist. When an IRB encounters studies involving science beyond the expertise of the members, the IRB may use a consultant to assist in the review, as provided by 21 CFR 56.107(f).\n\nFDA believes the intent of the requirement for diversity of disciplines was to include members who had little or no scientific or medical training or experience. Therefore, nurses, pharmacists and other biomedical health professionals should not be regarded to have \"primary concerns in the non-scientific area.\" In the past, lawyers, clergy and ethicists have been cited as examples of persons whose primary concerns would be in non-scientific areas.\n\nSome members have training in both scientific and non-scientific disciplines, such as a J.D., R.N. While such members are of great value to an IRB, other members who are unambiguously non-scientific should be appointed to satisfy the non-scientist requirement."

    "Question": "After reviewing E5 Ethnic Factors in the Acceptability of Foreign Clinical Data , My drug has been approved in two ICH regions and I am about to meet with regulatory authorities in the third region to discuss an application for marketing. I believe that the new regulatory authority should accept the present data, and that regulatory authority should require little or no additional data. What information should I submit to support my case that additional data are not needed?",
    "Answer": "There are two distinct issues that need to be considered: (1) the adequacy of the database and (2) the need for a bridging study. You will need to convince the regulatory authority that the available data are both adequate to meet the new region's requirements and that the data are applicable to the population of the new region. You should therefore indicate how your data address all the regulatory requirements of the new region. Where the choice of control groups, primary endpoints, or other key clinical trial design features are not those known to be considered acceptable to the new region, you should explain how and why they should be considered to meet the regulatory requirements of the new region.\n\nYou should also indicate why the data and conclusions should be considered relevant to the new population. In doing this, you should identify the intrinsic factors (e.g., racial distribution) that differ between the regions and show that those factors do not substantially affect the drug effect (i.e., demonstrate that the drug is insensitive to any differences in ethnic factors). Data indicating that pharmacologically related compounds have similar effects in the two regions can be quite useful.\n\nYou should also identify the extrinsic factors (e.g., diagnosis or management of the patient population studied) that you believe are generally similar to those in the intended population in the new region and explain why any significant differences would not alter conclusions to be drawn about the drug effect.\n\nDose-response relationships should be evaluated to determine if these are sensitive to intrinsic or extrinsic factors, and whether the appropriate doses might vary markedly among individuals or ethnic groups."

However, for products that have existing safety specifications submitted to different countries, it is not unusual for the particular safety concerns to differ across countries or regions. For example, a local regulatory authority might request that certain additional safety concerns be addressed. In addition, what is considered an important \"potential\" risk by the regulatory authority in one region might be considered an important \"identified\" risk by the regulatory authority in another region. Section 16.4 of the PBRER (Characterization of Risks) could be similarly affected. How should the MAH handle this situation?",
    "Answer": "The MAH should tailor the way it handles this situation based on the number of additional concerns or the range of different regional or national requests from the different regulatory authorities. One approach is detailed below, but it may not be optimal in every situation. If the MAH is unsure about which approach is best for its product, the MAH should seek guidance from the relevant regulatory authorities, particularly if there are substantial regional differences in the safety specifications. One approach to handling such a situation is described below: * When a PBRER will be submitted to regulatory authorities with previously different assessment conclusions on how a risk should be classified (potential or identified) or on the scope of information that should be documented in a risk management plan as missing information, the MAH can include all risks and missing information in the summary of safety concerns and clarify, using footnotes, those that are specific to only one country or region, indicating the country or region to which this additional safety concern applies. * If a safety concern is considered to be an important identified risk in one region and an important potential risk in another region, then the risk should appear under both categories within this section of the PBRER (see sample tabulation below). * In addition to the categorization from the different regulatory authorities, the MAH may wish to indicate the company core position on categorizing the various risks."

(3.2)",
    "Answer": "The ICH S7B guidance states that drug exposures should include and exceed anticipated therapeutic concentrations. If the in vivo QT data are to be used as part of an integrated risk assessment for situations described in ICH E14 Q&As Q12 (5.1) and Q13 (6.1), the exposure should cover the anticipated high clinical exposure scenario (see S7B Q&A Q17 (1.1)). An assessment of exposure in the same animals used for the pharmacodynamic assessment is encouraged. Sampling should take place at relevant timepoints and in a manner that limits interference with the pharmacodynamic effects. This could be done by sampling complete pharmacokinetic profiles in the same animals on a separate day after an adequate washout or different animals. At least one pharmacokinetic sample should be obtained during the pharmacodynamic assessment day to demonstrate consistency with the full pharmacokinetic profiles. In certain cases, the analysis of QTc interval together with adequate pharmacokinetic sampling makes it possible to perform dedicated exposure-response modeling similar to concentration-QT analysis for clinical QT studies. This can be helpful when the study should be powered to detect an effect similar to dedicated QT studies in humans (e.g., when using in vivo QT data as part of an integrated nonclinical and clinical risk assessment as described in ICH E14 Q&A Q13 (6.1)) because it can reduce the number of animals in accordance with the 3R (reduce/refine/replace) principles. In addition, exposure-response modeling may be helpful in other circumstances when QT prolongation is observed or anticipated based on hERG assay results."

    "Question": "This question is about Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels  Can I use Brix values to calculate the added sugars declaration for a product containing juice concentrates?",
    "Answer": "We use Brix values to calculate the labeled percentage of juice from concentrate found in a juice or juice beverage using the minimum Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30. We have determined that single strength (100 percent) juice contains at least the specified minimum Brix for each single strength juice listed in 21 CFR 101.30. For a juice concentrate, the added sugars are those that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type. Therefore, to calculate the added sugars in the concentrated juice ingredient, you need to know the amount of sugars in the 100 percent juice (i.e. single strength juice) of the same type. This may be obtained in several ways. For example, if you know the sugar content of the single strength fruit juice before it is concentrated and added to the product, because the amount of sugar from the single strength juice has been determined through chemical analysis, you may use the known sugar content when calculating and determining the added sugars declaration. You also may choose to use the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 as an estimate of the sugar content of the single strength juice. We recognize that industry uses the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1) when reconstituting juices as the minimum Brix that the 100 percent juice must have to meet. We understand that to account for process variability, industry may reconstitute to a slightly higher Brix to ensure that the 100 percent juice product consistently meet the minimum juice soluble solids requirements of 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1). Based on the information we have available to us, we would expect that the slight overage of juice soluble solids above the minimum Brix value used to account for process variability is small and would be consistent with our Current Good Manufacturing Practices3 (cGMPs). Therefore, we would not expect such slight overages to be included in the declaration of added sugars. However, if a product is designed to achieve a higher juice soluble solids concentration than what is required by the minimum Brix value for 100% juice (e.g., to increase sweetness) and the excess is above the cGMP variations described above, the amount of sugars that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type are added sugars, and must be declared as such as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule (also see Q&A 11 and 12). We require that, when a mixture of naturally occurring and added sugars is present in the food, a manufacturer must make and keep written records of the amount of added sugars added to the food during the processing of the food, and if packaged as a separate ingredient, as packaged (whether as part of a package containing one or more ingredients or packaged as a single ingredient) (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(iv)). If you use Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 to calculate the amount of added sugars in a product containing juice concentrate, you must document this information in the records regarding the amount of added sugars added to the food during processing (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)). If you use the amount of sugars present in a single strength juice and/or a juice concentrate, that is determined through chemical analysis or other available information, when calculating the amount of added sugars in a product containing fruit juice concentrate, you must document the source of the information and/or the amount of sugars determined through chemical analysis in the records that you make and keep (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). If a diluted juice concentrate slightly exceeds the amount of sugar that would be found in the same volume of the same type of 100 percent fruit juice, manufacturers should document the average and consistency with cGMPs in the records that they make and keep."

    "Question": "Delving into Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Is FDA willing to review and discuss a study protocol even if the study is exempt from most of the 21 CFR Part 812 requirements?",
    "Answer": "Yes. Both CDRH and CBER have developed processes that allow sponsors to obtain early FDA input and review of proposed studies by submission of the protocol and other study materials in the form of a \"pre-IDE\" document and/or a discussion in the form of a \"pre-IDE\" meeting. While we refer to this early input as a \"pre-IDE\" process, it is also available for studies that are exempt from most IDE requirements under 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3) or that will be conducted under the abbreviated IDE regulations for NSR studies (21 CFR 812.2). FDA encourages use of the pre-IDE submission and/or meeting whenever the sponsor desires early feedback for clinical studies, particularly those for novel or high risk (Class III) devices. If you (the sponsor) are interested in submitting a pre-IDE, werecommend that you contact the Division that will review your device **before** you initiate your studies (See **Introduction**, Section II, question # 4 of this guidance). Use of the pre-IDE process **does not** obligate you in any way to future submission of an IDE. FDA also encourages continued communication throughout the course of the study. This communication can be in the form of an informational meeting/telephone call or status reports to the pre-IDE file."

If I can successfully demonstrate (e.g., through a bridging study) that my safety, efficacy, and dosing information in the general population are relevant to the new region, will I also need to further address the extrapolatability of the special population data?",
    "Answer": "In general, if the studies of special populations are sufficient in design (e.g. include an appropriate range of severity of impairment) to address regulatory requirements of the new region, but are conducted in a foreign region, and if evidence supports the extrapolation of the data in the general population to the new region, you will probably not need to address the issue of special populations again in the new region.

    "Answer": "Section 630.10(c) requires the eligibility of all donors to be determined on the day of donation and before collection, with certain exceptions (21 CFR 630.10(c)(1)-(2)). Such determination is intended to ensure a donor's overall good health and that the donor is free from transfusion-transmitted infection (21 CFR 630.10(a)). A donor's eligibility to donate blood and blood components, including Source Plasma, is determined in part by a physical assessment and the donor's answers to questions concerning medical history and risk factors associated with exposure to, or clinical evidence of a relevant transfusion-transmitted infection and other conditions that may adversely affect the health of the donor or the safety, purity, or potency of the blood or blood components or any product manufactured from the blood or blood components.\n\nThe SPDHQ documents include the following materials:\n\n* Full-Length PPTA Donor History Questionnaire.\n* includes glossary, flow charts and references; describes how questions can be administered; and contains follow-up questions to further evaluate a potential donor's response to capture questions. (\"Capture\" questions ask a general question about a donor's history or behavior and are followed up by obtaining additional information about the donor if needed.)\n* Abbreviated PPTA Donor History Questionnaire.\n* includes glossary, flow charts and references; describes which donors may complete the questionnaire and how the questions can be administered; and contains follow-up questions to further evaluate a potential donor's response to capture questions.\n* contains a list of medications that may serve as a basis for donor deferral.\n* educates the donor about risks and conditions that are a basis for donor deferral.\n\nThe full-length and abbreviated donor history questionnaires are designed to be implemented together.

    "Question": "After reviewing Assessing User Fees Under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022 , Are reduced fees available for small businesses or others?",
    "Answer": "No. The majority of generic companies are small companies that are expected to benefit significantly from reductions in the review time needed to commercialize their products and from the certainty associated with performance review metrics and program efficiencies. In addition to diminishing the fee-paying base, the cost of a fee waiver or reduction provision would have added to the administrative cost of the GDUFA program. As such, no fee waiver or reduction provision was included. Congress specifically considered this issue and agreed with the decision not to have a fee waiver or reduction mechanism in GDUFA, whose individual fee amounts are expected to be orders of magnitude less than those in PDUFA."

    "Answer": "No, the name and address of the research facility is generally not a sufficient description to meet the requirement in 21 CFR 312.120(b)(2). Because FDA is generally less likely to be familiar with the research facilities in which foreign non-IND studies are conducted, greater detail is usually needed. For example, it would generally be adequate to identify and briefly describe the academic medical center, hospital, physician's office, clinical research unit or other type of facility at which the research is being conducted. The description should include enough information to enable FDA to determine the adequacy of the facilities to execute the protocol requirements (e.g., whether the site is appropriately staffed and equipped to conduct the proposed research and is able to provide the appropriate emergent or specialized care, if required)."

    "Question": "Having read through Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry, What is the purpose of the BPCI Act?",
    "Answer": "The BPCI Act amended the PHS Act and other statutes to create an abbreviated licensure pathway in section 351(k) of the PHS Act for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed biological reference product (see sections 7001 through 7003 of the BPCI Act). The objectives of the BPCI Act are conceptually similar to those of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-417) (commonly referred to as the \"Hatch-Waxman Amendments\"), which established abbreviated pathways for the approval of drug products under section 505(b)(2) and 505(j) of the FD&C Act. An abbreviated licensure pathway for biological products can present challenges given the scientific and technical complexities that may be associated with the generally larger, and typically more complex, structure of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured. Most biological products are produced in a living system, such as a microorganism or plant or animal cells, whereas small molecule drugs are typically manufactured through chemical synthesis."

    "Question": "After reviewing Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , Must dietary ingredients that I have added to my products be present at 100% of the amount that I declare?",
    "Answer": "For dietary ingredients that are specifically added, your product must contain 100% of the volume or weight that you have declared on the label, with the exception of a deviation that is attributable to the analytical method. Products that contain less than this amount of such a dietary ingredient would be misbranded and in violation of the law. Dietary ingredients that are naturally-occurring must be present at 80% of the declared value. For example, if you add vitamin C that was isolated from a natural source or made synthetically to your dietary supplement product, it would be subject to the 100% rule. However, if you added rose hips to your product, the vitamin C in the rose hips is naturally-occurring and must be present at least 80% of the declared value."

    "Question": "In light of the details from M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals , If a compound is being developed that aims to reduce another compound's side effect, such combination effects would be evaluated in clinical or nonclinical pharmacology studies. Do the pharmacology studies replace the combination toxicity study?",
    "Answer": "When combination toxicity studies are warranted, they generally cannot be replaced by combination pharmacology studies, except for anticancer pharmaceuticals (see ICH S9). The purpose of a combination toxicity study is to evaluate toxicity endpoints that could give rise to an unanticipated hazard for humans. These toxicity endpoints are not usually adequately evaluated in the pharmacology studies. Situations where combination toxicity studies are not warranted are described in section XVII (17) of the M3(R2) guidance."

(1.1)",
    "Answer": "The ICH S7B guidance describes a nonclinical strategy for assessing risk of delayed ventricular repolarization and QT interval prolongation (section II.C (2.3)). A mechanistic understanding of the development of torsade de pointes (TdP) and the emergence of new types of assays have made it possible to obtain more information to assess TdP risk from nonclinical assays.\n\nThe in vitro IKr/hERG assay and in vivo QT assay as well as optional follow-up studies, as described in the ICH S7B guidance, are conducted for hazard identification and risk assessment relevant to delayed ventricular repolarization. It is generally accepted that drugs (note that the word \"drug(s)\" in the S7B Q&As is used interchangeably with word \"pharmaceutical(s)\" in the ICH S7B guidance) that delay ventricular repolarization may have increased risk of TdP.\n\nIn addition to supporting the planning and interpretation of First-in-Human clinical studies, nonclinical investigations can also contribute to an integrated risk assessment for TdP in later stages of development when clinical data are available. The following are points to consider when using in vitro IKr/hERG data and in vivo QT data in combination with clinical QT data as part of an integrated risk assessment for situations described in ICH E14 Q&As Q12 (5.1) and Q13 (6.1)."

    "Question": "Taking into account the content of Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , If sugars are added to a food that already contains inherent sugars (e.g. yogurt), does that make \"added sugars\" a Class I nutrient for purposes of compliance under 21 CFR 101.9(g)? If so, does that mean that the composite must be formulated to be at least equal to the value for the added nutrient (added sugars) declared on the label per 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(i), or is 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) allowing up to 20% in excess of the value declared applicable?",
    "Answer": "Added sugars would be a nutrient in a fortified or fabricated food (21 CFR 101.9(g)(3)(i)). Added sugars is not a nutrient listed in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(i). The nutrients listed in this regulation include: vitamins, minerals, protein, and dietary fiber.\n\nWhen a food contains sugars that are endogenous and not exogenous sugars, the nutrient content of the composite for \"Total Sugars\" and \"Added Sugars\" would be subject to 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5). Section 101.9(g)(5) requires that the nutrient content of the composite be no greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label and states that no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved.\n\nHowever, because there are no generally recognized analytical methods available to quantify added sugars in a food when the food contains sugars that do and do not meet our definition of added sugars, the parenthetical after \"added sugars\" in SS 101.9(g)(5) states that, \"when the only source of sugars in the food is added sugars.\" The parenthetical is intended to clarify that the requirement in SS 101.9(g)(5) for the added sugars declaration would only apply when there is an analytical method available to quantify the added sugars. When a food contains a combination of sugars that do and do not meet our definition of added sugars, we would verify the declaration of added sugars in a food using the records required by SS 101.9(g)(10) and (11).\n\nWith respect to the total sugars declaration, SS 101.9(g)(5) would apply whether the food contains only added sugars, only sugars that do not meet our definition of added sugars, or a combination of these sugars in a food because there would be an analytical method to quantify \"Total Sugars\" under any of these circumstances.\n\nA food that already contains some endogenous sugar and additional added sugars, either directly or as a component in an ingredient, such as sweetened fruit added to yogurt, would be misbranded if the actual \"Total Sugars\" amount is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label, or the records requirements for \"Added Sugars\" are not met (see SS 101.9(g)(11))."

    "Answer": "We recommend that you begin with the exemptions in 21 CFR 812.2(c). Your\n\nproposed IVD study is exempt from most provisions of the IDE regulation if it fits any one of the following three categories:\n\na. The IVD is a pre-amendments device (i.e., a device that was in\n\ncommercial distribution prior to the enactment of the 1976 Medical\n\nDevice Amendments to the Act), other than a transitional device (see the\n\n**Glossary** for definition), and is used or investigated according to the\n\nindications in the labeling at that time.\n\nb. The IVD is a device, other than a transitional device, that has been\n\nfound to be substantially equivalent to a pre-amendments device and is\n\nused or investigated according to the indications in the labeling reviewed\n\nby FDA in determining substantial equivalence.\n\nc. The IVD\n\n\\({}^{\\star}\\) is properly labeled in accordance with 21 CFR 809.10(c);\n\n\\({}^{\\star}\\) is noninvasive (see question #5 below);\n\n\\({}^{\\star}\\) does not require an invasive sampling procedure that presents\n\nsignificant risk (see question #4 below);\n\n\\({}^{\\star}\\) does not by design or intention introduce energy into a subject;\n\n_and_\\(\\bullet\\) is not used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by another, medically established diagnostic product or procedure (see question # 6 below).\n\nFor your study to be exempt from most of the requirements of the IDE regulation under this third category, it must meet **all** of the conditions listed in \"c\" above. (See also the decision tree in Appendix 1.) You should refer to 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56 for applicable requirements relating to IRBs and informed consent, including for device studies that meet the criteria described in 21 CFR 812.2(c). Additionally, investigators for those studies are still subject to 21 CFR 812.119 (the provision entitled \"Disqualification of a clinical investigator.\")\n\nIf your proposed study does not fit into one of the three categories listed above, you, the sponsor, must have an approved IDE (21 CFR 812.2) before you may begin your investigation, including any shipment of your investigational IVD. (Note: A device that is approved under a premarket approval application (PMA) or cleared under a 510(k) and then used in a study in accordance with the approved or cleared labeling is not investigational and, therefore, is not subject to the IDE regulation.)\n\nThe requirements for an IDE depend on the level of risk that the study presents to subjects.\n\nFor a significant risk device (see the **Glossary** for definition), the sponsor must apply to FDA for an IDE approval (see 21 CFR 812.1, 812.20). For a non-significant risk device (see the **Glossary** for definition), the sponsor must meet the abbreviated requirements of 21 CFR 812.2(b), including review and approval of the investigation by an institutional review board (IRB) and compliance with informed consent requirements. A non-significant risk study is considered to have an approved IDE when the abbreviated requirements are met.\n\n**Note:** The requirements of the \"Protection of Human Subjects\" and \"Institutional Review Boards\" regulations (21 CFR Parts 50 and 56) apply to all clinical investigations regulated by FDA under section 520(g) of the Act, as well as other clinical investigations that support applications for research or marketing permits. (21 CFR 50.1, 56.101; see also Section V, Human Subject Protection, of this guidance.) Therefore, all studies of investigational IVDs that will support applications to FDA are subject to 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, even if they are not subject to most requirements of 21 CFR Part 812."

    "Question": "Guideline title: Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry  For biological products intended to be injected, how can an applicant demonstrate that its proposed biosimilar product has the same dosage form as the reference product? [Final December 2018]",
    "Answer": "Under section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(IV) of the PHS Act, an applicant must demonstrate that the \"dosage form\" of the proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product is the same as that of the reference product. For purposes of implementing this statutory provision, FDA considers the dosage form to be the physical manifestation containing the active and inactive ingredients that delivers a dose of the drug product. In the context of proposed biosimilar products intended to be injected, FDA considers, for example, \"injection\" (e.g., a solution) to be a different dosage form from \"for injection\" (e.g., a lyophilized powder). Thus, if the dosage form of the reference product is \"injection,\" an applicant could not obtain licensure of a proposed biosimilar product with a dosage form of \"for injection\" even if the applicant demonstrated that the proposed biosimilar product, when constituted or reconstituted, could meet the other requirements for an application for a proposed biosimilar product.\n\nFor purposes of section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(IV) of the PHS Act, FDA also considers emulsions and suspensions of products intended to be injected to be distinct dosage forms. Liposomes, lipid complexes, and products with extended-release characteristics present special scenarios due to their unique composition, and prospective applicants seeking further information should contact FDA.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that this interpretation regarding the same dosage form is for purposes of section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(IV) of the PHS Act only. For example, this interpretation should not be cited by applicants seeking approval of a new drug application under section 505(c) of the FD&C Act, approval of an abbreviated new drug application under section 505(j) of the FD&C Act, or licensure of a BLA under section 351(a) of the PHS Act for purposes of determining whether separate applications should be submitted and assessed separate fees for different dosage forms."

It is not sufficient for such documents to be included only in the TMF, which is not submitted in the marketing application.\n\nDocuments that provide critical information on a study, such as the protocol (16.1.1), statistical methods (16.1.9), list of investigators and study sites, and sample case report forms, would always be needed by reviewers assessing a study and should be included in the trial report even if they are in a TMF. Certain documents may be required for the CSR by individual countries or regions, in which case they should be included. For example, according to the ICH guidance _E6 Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance_,3 an audit certificate (16.1.8) should be provided when required by applicable law or regulation.

If sufficient clinical data (e.g., a completed Phase I or a monotherapy phase within Phase I) are available with the individual pharmaceuticals, additional nonclinical toxicology data may not be warranted. A rationale to support the combination should be provided, which can include in vitro or in vivo pharmacology data or a literature assessment.\n\nIf there are no or very limited human safety data for one of the combination components, a nonclinical pharmacology study of the combination should be considered, in addition to the toxicology studies with the single agents.\n\nFor pharmaceuticals that are pharmacologically inactive in animal species, assessment of combination can be based on relevant in vitro tests and/or a mechanistic understanding of target biology.\n\nIf the available clinical and nonclinical data are insufficient to establish a safe starting dose of the combination, a dedicated toxicology study may be needed with the combination to establish a safe starting dose in humans."

Pathology peer review can be particularly useful, for example,in situations where unique or unexpected findings are noted or when the peer-review pathologist has a particular expertise relevant to the study.\n\n21 CFR part 58 (GLP regulations for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies) includes general requirements for histopathology (for example, it requires written standard operating procedures (SOPs) for histopathology); however, pathology peer review is not specifically addressed in the GLP regulations. This guidance is intended to provide information to sponsors, applicants, and nonclinical laboratory personnel who choose to undertake pathology peer review during the conduct of a nonclinical toxicology study under GLP (referred to as a GLP toxicology study).\n\nCausal discussions, opinion exchange, and mentoring among pathologists are not covered by this guidance document.\n\nFDA acknowledges the need for interactions between the sponsor or applicant and study personnel during the conduct of a nonclinical toxicology study under GLP. Sponsors or applicants and persons2 performing study-related activities should have processes in place to ensure that the studies are transparent and free from undue influence that could impact the conclusions of the studies, including during contemporaneous (prospective)3 and retrospective pathology peer review.\n\nFootnote 2: Under 21 CFR 10.3 the term person includes an individual, partnership, corporation, association, scientific or academic establishment, government agency, or organizational unit thereof, and any other legal entity.\n\nFootnote 3: In the context of pathology peer review the terms \u201ccontemporaneous\u201d and \u201cprospective\u201d can be used interchangeably. The term \u201ccontemporaneous\u201d will be used in this guidance."

    "Question": "Taking into account the content of Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What are the rounding requirements for vitamins and minerals with RDIs?",
    "Answer": "The RDIs for some vitamins and minerals are small numerical values (e.g., copper 0.9 mg). Nutrients with an RDI of less than 5 would not be able to be declared on the Supplement Facts label if they contain less than 2 percent of the RDI (e.g. 2 percent of the RDI for copper is 0.018 mg) and the amount is declared to the nearest mg or microgram (mcg) (e.g. if the amount of copper in a serving of the product is 0.017, but is rounded to zero). The vitamins and minerals with an RDI of less than 5 mg or mcg are thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, copper, and manganese. With respect to the declared quantitative amounts of these vitamins and minerals, we consider it appropriate for manufacturers to declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest hundredth of a mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than the method of analysis, database, source of the nutrient, and/or calculation used for the declaration can scientifically support."

    "Answer": "No. These representations about the use of the product are not within the scope of the uses approved by FDA. Treatment of BRD and prevention of BRD are distinct indications, and this drug is not approved for prevention of BRD. The FDA-required labeling for treatment of BRD does not provide directions for using the product for disease prevention.\n\nMoreover, the administration of the drug to cattle 5 days before shipment to prevent BRD would reasonably be expected to increase the risk to health (including to the health of cattle and of humans) from resistant bacteria originating from treated cattle.

    "Answer": "Exploratory clinical studies do not represent a commitment to full development. Therefore, when intent is to conduct the exploratory clinical study in one sex only, the single-dose toxicity studies can be restricted to that sex. However, in such cases, animal group sizes for the Day 2 termination should be increased, as it is normal to combine effects from both sexes with respect to identifying and characterizing toxicities that are not sex-specific. For extended single-dose toxicity studies using a single sex, the usual animal numbers should be 15/group (rodents) or 5/group (nonrodents) for the Day 2 termination, and 7/group (rodents) or 3/group (nonrodents) for the Day 14 termination."

Is there a recommended approach to QT correction that is different from that specified in the ICH E14 guidance? (1.5)",
    "Answer": "Changes in heart rate could variably influence a drug's effect on repolarization (i.e., QT interval), and correction methods with different characteristics are often applied. The principles set below would be applicable in all clinical studies (thorough QT or other studies).\n\nIn adults, Bazett's correction has been clearly shown to be an inferior method of correcting for differences in heart rate among and within subjects. Therefore, QT interval data corrected using Bazett's corrections is no longer warranted in all applications unless there is a compelling reason for a comparison to historical Bazett's corrected QT data. Presentation of data with a Friderica's correction is likely to be appropriate in most situations, but other methods could be more appropriate. There is no single recommended alternative (see E14 Q&A Q4 (1.4) on Incorporating New Technologies), but the following are some considerations:\n\n1. Analyses of the same data using different models for correcting QT can generate discordant results. Therefore, it is important that the method(s) of correction, criteria for the selection of the method of correction, and rationale for the components of the method of correction be specified prior to analysis to limit bias. Model selection should be based on objective criteria and should consider the uncertainty in parameter estimates. Alternative methods of correction should be used only if the primary method fails the prespecified criteria for selection of the method of correction.\n2. Corrections that are individualized to a subject's unique heart rate QT dynamic are not likely to work well when the data are sparse or when the baseline data upon which the correction is based do not cover at least the heart rate range observed in patients on the study drug."

For these criteria to be met, both the patient's physician and FDA must make certain determinations.\n\nThe patient's physician must determine that the probable risk to the patient from the investigational drug is not greater than the probable risk from the disease or condition (SS 312.310(a)(1)). The physician should make this determination based on the information about the drug available to the physician and the physician's knowledge of the patient's clinical situation.\n\nAs with all types of expanded access, FDA must determine, based on the information available to FDA, that the potential benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment use with the drug and that those risks are not unreasonable in the context of the disease or condition to be treated(8 312.305(a)(2)). To authorize the expanded access use, FDA must also determine (1) that the patient has a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and has no other comparable or satisfactory therapeutic options (SS 312.305(a)(1)); (2) that providing expanded access will not interfere with development of the drug for the expanded access use (SS 312.305(a)(3)); and (3) that the patient cannot obtain the drug under another IND or protocol (SS 312.310(a)(2)) (e.g., in a clinical study of the drug)."

    "Answer": "An application for icensure of a biological product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act meets the definition of a \"biosimilar biological product application\" in section 744G(4) of the FD&C Act, with certain exceptions. Under section 744H(a)(2) of the FD&C Act, a biosimilar biological product application fee is assessed to the applicant at the time of submission of a biosimilar biological product application, unless an exception applies under section 744H(a)(2)(D). Certain applicants may be eligible for a small business waiver of the biosimilar biological product application fee under section 744H(d)(1) of the FD&C Act. If an applicant withdraws an NDA that is tentatively approved or pending on or before the transition date and later submits a biosimilar biological product application under section 351(k) of the PHS Act, the applicant would be assessed a biosimilar biological product application fee for the 351(k) application, unless a small business waiver has been granted or the applicant previously submitted a biosimilar biological product application for the same product and meets the other criteria for the exception described in section 744H(a)(2)(D) of the FD&C Act.

    "Question": "As per the details in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, The FDA regulations [21 CFR 56.104(c)] exempt an emergency use of a test article from prospective IRB review, however, \"... any subsequent use of the test article at the institution is subject to IRB review.\" What does the phrase \"subsequent use\" mean?",
    "Answer": "FDA regulations allow for one emergency use of a test article in an institution without prospective IRB review, provided that such emergency use is reported to the IRB within five working days after such use. An emergency use is defined as a single use (or single course of treatment, e.g., multiple doses of antibiotic) with one subject. \"Subsequent use\" would be a second use with that subject or the use with another subject.\n\nIn its review of the emergency use, if it is anticipated that the test article may be used again, the IRB should request a protocol and consent document(s) be developed so that an approved protocol would be in place when the next need arises. In spite of the best efforts of the clinical investigator and the IRB, a situation may occur where a second emergency use needs to be considered. FDA believes it is inappropriate to deny emergency treatment to an individual when the only obstacle is lack of time for the IRB to convene, review the use and give approval."

    "Question": "Drawing from the insights of M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals , When making a maximum feasible dose (MFD) argument, to what lengths should the sponsor go to justify the MFD?",
    "Answer": "The MFD should be a dose that attempts to maximize exposure in toxicity studies, rather than maximize the administered dose. However, formulation volumes that can be administered should be based on anatomical and physiological attributes of the test species and properties of the formulation, and can have an impact on the MFD. In addition, the chemical and physical stability of the formulation are important criteria for suitability for use in toxicity studies and could limit the selection of vehicles for determining the MFD. Solubility limits can restrict the dose for some routes, such as intravenous. Solubility limits are not usually considered sufficient to justify the MFD for some other routes of administration, such as inhalation or oral. The characteristics of multiple formulations of the test article, with a range of properties (e.g., aqueous and non-aqueous and various viscosities), should be investigated before dosing in animals. The most promising formulations (generally three) should be evaluated in animals to determine which formulation produces maximal exposure. The vehicles used should be well characterized in the scientific literature or selected based on experience (sponsor or regulatory agency information) to provide confidence that they will not cause significant toxicity under conditions of use."

    "Question": "After reviewing Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Is a pedigree required for products already in the supply chain as of December 1, 2006?",
    "Answer": "It depends. A pedigree would be required for prescription drug products that are sold, purchased, or traded by a non-ADR after December 1, 2006. In order to give wholesalers sufficient time to prepare and deplete stock that would require a pedigree after December 1, FDA provided 6 months' notice that the stay would expire on December 1, 2006. However, FDA recognizes that there may be some situations where a wholesaler has prescription drugs in stock that were purchased while the wholesaler considered itself an ADR, yet the wholesaler clearly will not be an ADR for those drugs under 21 C.F.R. SS 202.3(u) after December 1, 2006. FDA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion until April 1, 2007 regarding the pedigree requirement for such drugs, provided that the wholesaler can furnish documentation that the drugs were purchased prior to December 1, 2006, and that it had purchased the same type of drugs from the manufacturer on at least two prior occasions in the previous 24 months. Bills of sale or invoices could be used for this documentation. Wholesalers that cannot meet this criteria with respect to their inventories will be expected to provide a pedigree for those drugs. FDA believes that the combination of the six month notice that the stay would expire, along with additional four months of enforcement discretion, as described above,provides the wholesalers described above with sufficient time to deplete their pre-December 1, 2006 inventories."

The statute defines applicable clinical trials as trials of drugs and devices that are subject to FDA regulation. If the clinical trial is not of a drug or device subject to FDA regulation, and, thus, not an applicable clinical trial, at the time of the initiation of the trial, then the statement is not required. See the response to questions 3 and 4 concerning the definition of an applicable clinical trial.\n\nFDA accepts data from foreign clinical trials not under an IND when in compliance with 21 CFR SS 312.120. The mere fact that we accept data from a foreign clinical trial in connection with a marketing application does not make it an applicable clinical trial; the foreign clinical trial constitutes an applicable clinical trial only when it meets the definitions set forth in 42 U.S.C. SS 282(j)(1)(A).

    "Question": "As explained in Direct Final Rule Procedures Guidance for FDA and Industry, What is the significance of triclosan and triclocarban under this final rule?",
    "Answer": "Based on available data, triclosan and triclocarban have been two of the most widely used OTC consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients on the market -- with triclosan being used primarily in liquid antiseptic soaps and triclocarban being used primarily in bar antiseptic soaps. Emerging research shows that some antibacterial ingredients could pose health risks. For example, some data suggest that triclosan and triclocarban can cause alterations in thyroid, reproductive growth, and developmental systems of neonatal and adolescent animals. Because consumer antiseptic washes are chronic use products, evaluation of the potential for chronic toxicity and the effects on reproduction and development are essential to the safety assessment of these active ingredients.\n\nAs explained in the final rule, insufficient data were submitted to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of triclosan and triclocarban for use as a consumer antiseptic wash product, and thus, we found that triclosan and triclocarban are not GRASE for use in consumer antiseptic wash products. Accordingly, to continue marketing as of the effective date of the final rule, OTC consumer antiseptic wash products containing triclosan or triclocarban will require (1) reformulation to remove triclosan or triclocarban and relabeling of the reformulated products; or (2) approval of a new drug application."

    "Question": "As stated in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, If a clinical investigation is not conducted under an IND or is for a medical device, must investigators sign a 1572?",
    "Answer": "No. Under the regulations, a 1572 is only required for studies of investigational drugs and biologics conducted under an IND. It is not required for studies that are not done under an IND, and is not applicable to investigational device studies. Sponsors of device studies must obtain a signed investigator agreement (containing information similar to that requested on the 1572) from each participating investigator, per 21 CFR 812.43(c)."

    "Answer": "Yes. The GLPs were written with the aim of being applicable to a broad variety of studies, test articles and test systems. Nonetheless, the agency realizes that not all of the GLP provisions apply to all studies and, indeed, For some special studies certain of the GLP provisions may compromise proper science. For this reason, laboratories may petition the agency for exemption for certain studies from some of the GLP provisions. The petition should contain sufficient facts to justify granting the exemption."

    "Question": "Having read through M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals , For non-fixed-dose combinations, if one of the agents is a member of a class containing multiple approved products, should each member of the class be tested in a combination toxicity study?",
    "Answer": "Generally, combination toxicity studies are recommended when there is an intent to combine (co-package or administer in a single dosage form) specific drugs, or when the product information of one drug recommends co-use with another specified drug. There is no recommendation for combination toxicity testing in the guidance for the situation described in this question. When there is a specific cause for concern with an agent, combination toxicity testing should be done with the agent. When there is a class-related cause for concern, a combination toxicity study with a representative agent in the class could be informative (see also Q&A3 in this section). A rationale should be provided for the agent selected for testing."

    "Question": "As described in None, Why is FDA requiring all IRBs that review FDA-regulated studies to register?",
    "Answer": "Because our information at the present time is derived from research and marketing applications,\n\nFDA (we) cannot be certain that we have current information about IRBs that review FDA-regulated studies. For example, some drug and device studies are exempt from the\n\nInvestigational New Drug (IND, 21 CFR Part 312) and Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE,\n\n21 CFR 812) submission requirements and are conducted without FDA involvement. In\n\naddition, many device studies (e.g., non-significant risk and many in vitro diagnostic (IVD)\n\nstudies) are conducted with only IRB approval. We, therefore, do not have real-time information about these studies or the IRBs that review them.\n\nIn addition, several reports from the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) regarding our oversight of the conduct of clinical studies3 recommended IRB registration, stressing the importance of a comprehensive listing of all IRBs that review FDA-regulated research. The 2001 OIG report also expressed concern about our ability to assure an equivalent level of human subject protection in clinical studies of FDA-regulated products conducted outside of the U.S. as compared to those conducted in the U.S. While registration of non-U.S. IRBs (often referred to as Independent or Research Ethics Committees - IECs/RECs) is voluntary, information we receive from them will be helpful in addressing this concern.\n\nFootnote 3: \u201cInstitutional Review Boards \u2013 A Time for Reform\u201d (1998) available at http://www.oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-01-97-00193.pdf; \u201cThe Globalization of Clinical Trials\u201d (2001) available at http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-01-00-00190.pdf; and \u201cThe Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Oversight of Clinical Trials (2007) available at http://www.oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-01-06-00160.pdf."

    "Answer": "We recommend against using the GTIN in place of a separate NDC in the human-readable portion of the product identifier. Under the DSCSA, the product identifier must include the NDC in both human-readable and machine-readable form.30 As described in 21 CFR 207.33(b)(1), the human-readable NDC is generally a 10 or 11-digit number, in a 3-segment format, that identifies the labeler, product, and trade package size/type.31 We recommend that this 3-segment format be followed for purposes of including the NDC in the human-readable format portion of product identifiers because it is a well-recognized means of representing the NDC and its use benefits patient safety."

    "Answer": "Use of Option 4 is appropriate when a mutagenic impurity has a negligible risk of being present in the final drug substance. The risk can be considered negligible if predictive purge calculations based on scientific principles (e.g., impurity reactivity or solubility) result in impurity levels less than 1 percent of TTC or AI. When predictive purge calculations result in impurity levels greater than 1 percent of TTC or AI, measured purge factors (i.e., spike and purge data) showing impurity levels less than 10 percent of TTC or AI should be provided to justify Option 4 control. The process-relevant conditions should be considered for the purge calculation and the generation of analytical data. The acceptability of Option 4 will be assessed by authorities on a case-by-case basis, including additional requests for supporting information.

    "Answer": "The intravenous (i.v.) approach of using mg/kg and permitting dosing with 1/100th of the NOAEL reflects a conservative risk mitigation strategy, considering the low levels of drug being administered. The use of mg/kg for i.v. and mg/m\\({}^{2}\\) for oral administration when determining dose multiples for microdose studies reflects the thinking that it is appropriate to use a more conservative scaling factor for oral versus i.v. administration.

Additionally, test results from the exempt IVD investigation should not influence patient treatment or clinical management decisions before the diagnosis is established by a medically established product or procedure.\n\nIf an investigational test uses a new technology or represents a significant technological advance, established diagnostic products or procedures may not be adequate to confirm the diagnosis provided by the investigational IVD. For example, if an investigational test is designed to identify an infection at the earliest stages of viral infection (before formation of antibodies), established diagnostic products or procedures that rely on the detection of antibodies to the virus would be inadequate to confirm diagnoses. Under these conditions the study would not meet the criteria for exemption under 812.2(c)(3) since the testing could not be confirmed with a medically established diagnostic product or procedure. You may consider whether the device is a non-significant risk device subject to abbreviated IDE requirements (21 CFR 812.2(b))."

    "Question": "This question is about Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry  Can a proposed biosimilar product have a delivery device or container closure system that is different from its reference product? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]",
    "Answer": "The draft guidance _Considerations in Demonstrating Interchangeability With a Reference Product_ (January 2017) provides recommendations to sponsors planning to develop a proposed therapeutic protein product as an interchangeable product with a reference product. It is possible for a proposed biosimilar product to have a delivery device or container closure system that is different from that of the reference product and still meet the statutory standards for biosimilarity. For example, a proposed biosimilar product that would be administered by an autoinjector could be shown to be biosimilar to a reference product that is administered by a pre-filled syringe, provided that certain criteria are met (e.g., similarity in drug product formulation and delivery device critical design attributes).  A proposed interchangeable product, however, must meet additional statutory standards, including data and information demonstrating that the proposed interchangeable product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product (e.g., PK/PD/toxicokinetic profiles comparing the proposed interchangeable product to the reference product). For more information about FDA's current thinking on the development and assessment of interchangeable products, see the draft guidance _Considerations in Demonstrating Interchangeability With a Reference Product._ This guidance is part of FDA\u2019s ongoing implementation of the BPCI Act and is an update to the draft guidance _Considerations in Demonstrating Interchangeability With a Reference Product_ (January 2017).

Will pending NDAs that are withdrawn and submitted as BLAs be reviewed within the same CDER review office/division?",
    "Answer": "In general, approved NDAs that are deemed to be BLAs will remain within the same review office/division within CDER's Office of New Drugs (OND) after the transition date, subject to any reassignments related to any reorganization of CDER's OND. Similarly, pending NDAs that are withdrawn and submitted as BLAs will be reviewed within the same OND review office/division.\n\nWith respect to the product quality assessment, review responsibilities within CDER's Office of Pharmaceutical Quality (OPQ) for products composed of amino acid polymers are in the process of being assigned or reassigned based on certain characteristics of the molecule, rather than the regulatory pathway, with the expectation that the reassignments will be completed by the transition date.

    "Question": "This question is about Elemental Impurities in Drug Products Guidance for Industry  Even in cases where the COA includes results for elemental impurities and a specific risk factor has been identified, often the excipient or drug substance make up a small percentage of the drug product or the COA results demonstrate that the elements are controlled at low levels. Is there a threshold at which we would not be expected to confirm the COA results?",
    "Answer": "If the elemental impurity content listed on the COA will lead to a daily exposure that is not more than 30% of the PDE for an element, the risk from the component can usually be considered below the threshold at which additional testing by the drug product manufacturer is necessary (see Appendix I), and confirmation of the COA values for elemental impurities will not be requested. If the 30% control threshold will be applied, the total daily exposure should not exceed 30% of the PDE in cases where the same element may be introduced by multiple components of the drug product.\n\nIf the 30% threshold is exceeded but the elements are below the PDE, the drug product manufacturer should confirm the component COA results for vendor qualification, or, alternatively, test every lot of the drug product to ensure that the element does not exceed the PDE. A test that is selective for the element should be used unless an alternative approach can be justified. The test method(s) and limit(s) should be submitted to the file (see Q11 below). Reduced testing may be appropriate for a qualified supplier in accordance with 21 CFR 211.84(d)(2). The test may also be discontinued if sufficient data are generated to support that the element remains below 30% of the PDE."

    "Answer": "Some studies are exempt from most of 21 CFR Part 812 because of the low risk they pose to study subjects. However, studies that will support a PMA or other premarket submission should have the same goals as all other device studies: 1) to produce valid scientific evidence to support reasonable assurance of a product's safety and effectiveness, and 2) to protect study subjects. Therefore, the information in 21 CFR Part 812 will also be useful to sponsors and investigators of device studies exempt under 21 CFR 812.2(c).

    "Question": "In light of the details from E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , What is the approach to evaluating QTc in late stage clinical development?",
    "Answer": "The purpose of a thorough QT study is to characterize the effect of the drug on ventricular repolarization (QT interval). It is not the purpose of the thorough QT study to assess the risk of torsade de pointes (TdP) in the target population, but rather to determine whether further data are warranted to assess risk. A finding of QT prolongation above the regulatory threshold of interest (a positive thorough QT study) might call for further electrocardiographic follow-up in late phase studies. The extent of the follow-up would be affected by the magnitude of the estimated prolongation at doses and concentrations at which this occurs. If prolongation is substantial at concentrations expected to occur in clinical studies, it is important to protect patients in later trials and to obtain further information on the frequency of marked QT prolongation. In some cases in which there is a large margin of safety between therapeutic exposures and the exposures that result in significant ECG interval changes, an intensive ECG follow-up strategy might not be warranted."

    "Answer": "The FDA letter that notifies the application holder that its approved NDA is deemed to be an approved BLA will include the U.S. license number assigned to the application holder. Each establishment that is listed in the approved NDA as currently involved in the manufacture of the biological product on the transition date will be considered a licensed establishment on that date (see section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act; see also section 7002(e)(4)(B)(iii) of the BPCI Act). FDA does not intend to conduct pre-license inspections of manufacturers of the transitioning biological products because FDA interprets section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act to mean that an approved application under the FD&C Act for the biological product will be \"deemed to be a license\" on the transition date by operation of the statute.12 Moreover, the establishments will have been inspected in connection with the previously approved NDAs under the FD&C Act (see Q16 below for information on establishment inspections related to certain supplements to a deemed 351(a) BLA)."

    "Question": "Looking at the guidelines in E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations- Geriatrics , What should be taken into account when estimating an adequate representation of geriatric patients to be included in the clinical database?",
    "Answer": "It is very important to ensure, to the extent possible, that the population included in the clinical development program is representative of the target patient population. As stated in the current ICH E7 guidance, estimates of the prevalence of the disease to be treated by age or examination of the age distribution of usage for other drugs of the same class or for the same indication should be provided by the applicant. This will indicate the expected use of the drug and should influence the number of geriatric patients to be included in the marketing application. The current guidance states, \"for drugs used in diseases not unique to, but present in, the elderly, a minimum of 100 patients would usually allow detection of clinically important differences.\" Given the increasing prevalence and the growing recognition of thecomplexity of the geriatric population, including concomitant therapies and co-morbidities, it would usually be appropriate to include more than 100 geriatric patients in the phase 2 and 3 databases and include patients over the entire spectrum of the geriatric patient population. In the marketing application, depending on the numbers of patients, data should be presented for various age groups (for example \\(<\\)65, 65-74, 75-84, and \\(\\geq\\) 85) to assess the consistency of the treatment effect and safety profile in these patients with the nongeriatric patient population. As single trials may not have sufficient numbers of geriatric patients to allow such analyses, these will often need to be carried out on pooled data. Any such analyses will need to consider consistency across studies."

    "Question": "As explained in Treatment Use of Investigational Drugs Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Can the same drug be used in an emergency situation at the same institution more than once? If so, is prospective IRB review required for the subsequent expanded access emergency use?",
    "Answer": "There can be more than one expanded access emergency use of the same drug at the same institution. For expanded access uses authorized under the emergency procedures, the emergency use must be reported to the responsible IRB within 5 working days of initiation of treatment (21 CFR 56.104(c)). Generally, once an investigational drug is used in an emergency situation without prior IRB approval, any subsequent uses of the investigational drug at that same institution would require prior IRB review and approval (SS 56.104(c)). An institution or physician that expects subsequent use of the investigational drug should request review and approval by the appropriate IRB after the initial emergency use. However, when prior IRB review and approval is not feasible for a subsequent expanded access emergency use at a particular institution, FDA does not intend to deny the subsequent request for emergency use based on lack of time to obtain prospective IRB review, as long as that use will be reported to the IRB within 5 working days of initiation of treatment (SS 56.104(c))."

    "Question": "With reference to Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Do non-ADRs have to provide a pedigree if the customer is a physician's office?",
    "Answer": "Yes. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) requires non-ADRs to provide a pedigree before each wholesale distribution of a drug. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc), wholesale distribution is defined as the distribution of prescription drugs to persons other than a consumer or patient. Although a physician's office is not explicitly mentioned in 21 CFR SS 203.50, which discusses pedigree, it is contemplated within the scope of the language set forth in SS 503(e)(1)(A) of the Act that a pedigree would be provided because physicians offices are not specifically excluded."

Therefore, no pedigree would be required. However, the sale, purchase, or trade of those drugs to another pharmacy or wholesale distributor would be considered a wholesale distribution and a pedigree must be provided if that other pharmacy or distributor is not an ADR. If pedigrees are part of the record for the inventory, they must be provided with the sale, purchase, or trade of the product and retained for the appropriate length of time, as required under 21 CFR SSSS203.50(b) and 203.60(d)."

    "Question": "As stated in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , How were the critical process parameters identified, monitored, and/or controlled?",
    "Answer": "A critical process parameter (CPP) is any measurable input (input material attribute or operating parameter) or output (process condition or output material attribute) of a process step that must be controlled to achieve the desired product quality and process consistency. Scale independent CPPs, such as material attributes, are the most valuable, because they can be directly used for scale up. For example, a material attribute CPP, such as moisture content, should have the same target value in the pilot batch process and the commercial scale process. An operating parameter CPP, such as air flow rate, would be expected to change as the process scale changes."

    "Question": "Looking at the guidelines in M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals , In the discussion of inclusion of WOCBP in combination drug development, M3(R2) states, \"where... individual agent(s) have shown findings indicative of embryo-fetal risk, combination studies are not recommended as a potential human developmental hazard has already been identified.\" What is meant by the phrase \"have shown findings indicative of embryo-fetal risk\"? FDA's guidance for industry on Nonclinical Safety Evaluation of Drug or Biologic Combinations references Pregnancy Category D and X only as yielding this exclusion. Is this the intent for the ICH as well?",
    "Answer": "A finding indicative of embryo-fetal risk includes any observations for reproductive hazard at relevant exposure multiples (within approximately an order of magnitude of the clinical exposure) or directly related to the pharmacodynamics of the drug. In these cases, recommendations about patient actions to minimize the identified hazard would likely be unchanged even if data from a combination study showed an enhanced effect, because a significant risk to patients has already been identified. Therefore, combination reproductive toxicity studies are not recommended when a finding with one of the individual agents indicates embryo-fetal risk; that information would be made available to patients and physicians as part of the risk communication, irrespective of pregnancy category. For example, if studies with one of the agents showed fetal death or terata at approximately 10-fold the clinical exposure, even if observed in only one species, a combination study would not be warranted, provided that this information was present in the single agent product labeling."

    "Question": "Delving into Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, What does FDA recommend that firms consider when developing CFL promotional communications that are consistent with the FDA-required labeling to help ensure that the presentation of this information does not render the communication false or misleading?",
    "Answer": "The way a firm presents information that is consistent with the FDA-required labeling (including the express and implied claims made and the overall impression created by the communication as a whole) affects how the information is understood. The following are some high-level recommendations for firms to consider when developing their presentations of information in CFL promotional communications to help ensure the presentations do not mislead the applicable audience(s):\n\n* Any study results or other data and information that are relied upon to support a firm's CFL promotional communication should be accurately represented in the communications. Moreover, aspects of study design and methodology that are material for audiences to accurately interpret the information presented (e.g. type of study, study objectives, product dosage/use regimens, controls used, patient population studied) from any studies relied on should be clearly and prominently25 disclosed in firms' CFL promotional communications, and material limitations related to the study design, methodology, and results should also be disclosed in a clear and prominent manner.\n* The CFL promotional communication should accurately characterize and contextualize the relevant information about the product, including by disclosing unfavorable or inconsistent findings. For example, if a firm presents efficacy results from a postmarketing study of its product that evaluated the effect of the product on two different endpoints, such as overall survival and progression-free survival, and the product failed to demonstrate an effect on one of these two endpoints, the firm should clearly and prominently disclose this in the CFL promotional communication, rather than selectively presenting only the positive efficacy results.\n* If the FDA-required labeling contains data or information related to what is being represented/suggested in the CFL promotional communication, the communication should also include the data or information from the FDA-required labeling to provide the audience with appropriate context, and this information should be presented in a clear and prominent way. For example, if a communication provides postmarketing information about the types and rates of occurrence of adverse events that have been observed in practice, the communication should also include information from the FDA-required labeling about the types and rates of occurrence of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials to provide context."

The tissues would not be part of the nonclinical laboratory study design and the results would not necessarily pertain to the study objectives. What would the GLPs require in this case?",
    "Answer": "The protocol should state that tissues are to be taken from the experimental animals and that the tissues would be used for exploratory research purposes. If any effects were observed in the exploratory research studies which would influence the interpretation of the results of the nonclinical laboratory study, these effects must be report in the final report."

    "Question": "After reviewing Medical Device Reporting for Manufacturers Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, How does FDA intend to implement this guidance for HCEI disseminated in accordance with section 502(a)?",
    "Answer": "If a firm disseminates to an appropriate audience HCEI that is the type of information within the scope of section 502(a) (i.e., HCEI that relates to an approved indication and is based on competent and reliable scientific evidence (CARSE), as each of these elements is described in this guidance), FDA does not intend to consider such information false or misleading. HCEI should clearly and prominently present the information discussed in Q.A.7/A.A.7 and Q.A.8/A.A.8 of this section, including study design and methodology, generalizability, limitations, sensitivity analyses, and information relevant to providing a balanced and complete presentation. If HCEI includes material differences from the FDA-approved labeling (e.g., new or increased risks, different dosing/use regimens, different endpoints, more-limited/targeted patient populations), it must present \"a conspicuous and prominent statement describing any material differences between the health care economic information and the labeling approved for the drug,\"22 as discussed in Q.A.7/A.A.7."

    "Question": "Delving into Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, The number of studies we review has increased, and the size of the package of review materials we send to IRB members is becoming formidable. Must we send the full package to all IRB members?",
    "Answer": "The IRB system was designed to foster open discussion and debate at convened meetings of the full IRB membership. While it is preferable for every IRB member to have personal copies of all study materials, each member must be provided with sufficient information to be able to actively and constructively participate. Some institutions have developed a \"primary reviewer\" system to promote a thorough review. Under this system, studies are assigned to one or more IRB members for a full review of all materials. Then, at the convened IRB meeting the study is presented by the primary reviewer(s) and, after discussion by IRB members, a vote for an action is taken.\n\nThe \"primary reviewer\" procedure is acceptable to the FDA if each member receives, at a minimum; a copy of consent documents and a summary of the protocol in sufficient detail to determine the appropriateness of the study-specific statements in the consent documents. In addition, the complete documentation should be available to all members for their review, both before and at the meeting. The materials for review should be received by the membership sufficiently in advance of the meeting to allow for adequate review of the materials.\n\nSome IRBs are also exploring the use of electronic submissions and computer access for IRB members. Whatever system the IRB develops and uses, it must ensure that each study receives an adequate review and that the rights and welfare of the subjects are protected."

    "Question": "This question is about Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors What if my study has received approval only for particular sites by March 7, 2012?",
    "Answer": "If an IRB has already approved _any_ informed consent documents for the applicable clinical trial prior to March 7, 2012, then the trial will be considered \"initiated\" before the compliance date, and the new statement will not be required. For example, if an IRB approves consent documents for a particular site for a multi-site trial before March 7, 2012, but documents for another site have not been approved by that date, then all documents for the entire applicable clinical trial will be exempt from including the statement and do not need to be in compliance with the provision. If an IRB has not approved any informed consent documents for the applicable clinical trial by March 7, 2012, then all informed consent documents associated with the applicable clinical trial must in compliance with the requirement and include the new statement.\n\nIf the multi-site applicable clinical trial includes multiple IRBs or the multi-site applicable clinical trial is under one IRB, the effect is still the same.

    "Question": "Guideline title: Oversight of Clinical Investigations \u2014 A Risk-Based Approach to Monitoring Guidance for Industry What elements should sponsors include in monitoring plans?",
    "Answer": "Monitoring plans should be developed for each investigation based on the risk assessment for that investigation. Monitoring plans should address both study-specific and site-specific risks. Monitoring plans also should be designed to enable the management of anticipated and unanticipated risks. As stated earlier, sponsors are encouraged to develop risk-based monitoring plans that emphasize critical risks with the greatest potential to adversely affect investigation quality, including (1) the rights, safety, and welfare of participants in a clinical investigation; and (2) the collection or analysis of critical clinical data such as safety and efficacy/effectiveness endpoints. Section IV.D of the 2013 RBM guidance discusses in detail the recommended components of a monitoring plan. Sponsors also may reference in the monitoring plan other clinical trial management plans used for risk management (e.g., a data management plan) that address the components recommended in the 2013 RBM guidance rather than repeat the same information in the monitoring plan.\n\nIn addition to the components recommended in the 2013 RBM guidance, FDA recommends that monitoring plans also include the following components, which will help explain how the sponsor intends to address the risks that could affect the clinical investigation:\n\n* A description of the investigation design, including the blinding and randomization procedures, if applicable\n* Processes for confirming that randomization is performed according to the protocol and investigational plan or plans\n* The sampling plan or plans that will be used to identify the specific records and data that will be monitored, including (1) the rationale for how the sampling plan provides a representative picture of the overall information and (2) how the sampling plan will be implemented\n* A description of the types of issues identified through monitoring that would trigger immediate issue escalation* An approach for determining whether (1) an important issue that is detected at a clinical site may also be present at other clinical sites; and (2) the finding suggests a systemic problem with the protocol or associated investigational plans that requires remediation"

    "Answer": "For any drug intended to provide systemic exposure (including transdermal), the 50-fold approach is considered appropriate. For topical drugs intended to produce local effects, the high dose in topical toxicity studies should generally be based on the MFD or MTD and might not achieve high local concentrations or high systemic exposures compared to those achieved clinically. In this case, a 50-fold systemic margin is not relevant.\n\nFor inhaled drugs with intended systemic action, the high dose in an inhalation toxicity study could be one that produces an AUC value of greater than or equal to 50-fold the clinical systemic exposure and a 10-fold margin over the calculated deposited lung dose. For inhaled drugs that are designed to work locally in the lungs, the high dose could be one that achieved a calculated deposited lung dose of 50 times the calculated clinical deposited lung dose and produced a 10-fold margin over the AUC achieved in humans at the clinical dose."

    "Answer": "An HCT/P remains \"such HCT/P\" when it is in its original form. Generally, the only processing steps that will allow an HCT/P to remain \"such HCT/P\" are rinsing, cleansing, sizing, and shaping.\n\nFurther, as described in the answer to Q1, the assessment of whether an HCT/P is \"such HCT/P\" under 21 CFR 1271.15(b) is different from the assessment of whether an HCT/P is minimally manipulated under 21 CFR 1271.10(a). Accordingly, even processing that may be considered minimal manipulation within 21 CFR 1271.10(a), will typically cause the HCT/P to no longer be \"such HCT/P\" under 21 CFR 1271.15(b), if the processing is not limited to rinsing, cleansing, sizing, or shaping."

    "Question": "When considering the information from Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Example 2_: Drug A is approved for the long-term, maintenance treatment of asthma patients 12 years of age and older. The safety and efficacy of Drug A for this indication was evaluated versus placebo treatment in a randomized, double-blind study. The study also included an active comparator (Drug B), approved for the same indication and with a comparable risk profile, which was similarly evaluated versus placebo. The study was not designed to test the non-inferiority or superiority of Drug A directly against Drug B (i.e., the Drug B arm was included for assay sensitivity). Drug A and Drug B demonstrated statistically significant improvements versus placebo in the co-primary efficacy endpoints, but Drug A's results showed a numerically greater improvement versus placebo than those for Drug B. Based on this study, Drug A's firm develops promotional materials to communicate that Drug A is clinically superior to Drug B for the long-term, maintenance treatment of asthma patients 12 years of age and older.",

    "Question": "When considering the information from Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, How will FDA ensure the quality of imported products while inspections are limited?",
    "Answer": "During this interim period, FDA is expanding the use of other tools and approaches for assessing manufacturing facilities, when appropriate, to help ensure the quality of the drug products imported into the United States. These may include physical examinations of products arriving at U.S. borders or product sampling and testing before release into commerce, reviewing the compliance histories of facilities, using information shared by trusted foreign regulatory partners through mutual recognition agreements and other confidentiality agreements, requestingrecords directly from facilities \"in advance of or in lieu of\" certain drug inspections,9 and conducting remote interactive evaluations where appropriate. If a product appears not to meet applicable standards for safety, effectiveness, or quality based on these approaches, FDA has the authority to refuse admission of the product into the United States.10\n\nFDA continues to work with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to target products intended for importation into the United States that violate applicable legal requirements for FDA-regulated products. FDA has the ability to use a risk-based analytics tool (Predictive Risk-based Evaluation for Dynamic Import Compliance Targeting (PREDICT)) to electronically screen regulated shipments imported or offered for import into the United States.11 PREDICT uses automated data mining, pattern discovery, and automated queries of FDA databases to determine the potential risk of a shipment.

    "Question": "When considering the information from E5 Ethnic Factors in the Acceptability of Foreign Clinical Data , I am planning to develop my new drug globally. Does E5 provide guidance for this approach?",
    "Answer": "E5 does provide some guidance in this situation. E5 addresses primarily how development programs in one or two regions might support approval in another region. E5 says, in general, that if the data developed in one region satisfy the requirements for evidence in a new region, but there is a concern about possible intrinsic or extrinsic ethnic differences between the two regions, then it should be possible to extrapolate the data to the new region with a single bridging study. The bridging study could be a pharmacodynamic study or a full clinical trial, possibly a dose-response study. The bridging study would allow extrapolation of an adequate database to the new region. It would seem possible, and efficient, to assess potential regional differences as part of a global development program, i.e., for development of data to occur simultaneously in various regions, rather than sequentially. For example, if multi-regional trials had a sufficient number of trial subjects from the new region, it might be possible to analyze the impact of ethnic differences in those studied, to determine whether the entire database is pertinent to the new region. The basic issues to be considered in a global study design that could affect a region's willingness to rely on these data are: (a) definition and diagnoses of disease condition and patient, (b) choice of control group, (c) regional target or objective of treatment with choice of efficacy variables, (d) methods of assessment of safety, (e) medical practice, (f) duration of the trial, (g) regional concomitant medications, (h) severity distribution of eligible subjects, and (i) similarity of dose and dose regimens. To determine whether your proposed global program will address the requirements of a specific region, it is recommended that early consultation and discussions be held with regulatory authorities in that region."

However, these labeling requirements do not apply to foods provided by a retail or food service establishment that are placed in a wrapper or container in response to a consumer's order, such as the paper or box used to transport a sandwich that has been prepared in response to a consumer's order.\nFDA's Food Code is a model code available for local, state, and other jurisdictions to adopt and apply to retail food establishments, including restaurants, grocery stores, supermarkets, hospitals, nursing homes, child-care centers, and temporary food establishments that provide food directly to consumers. The 2017 FDA Food Code contains provisions regarding food allergens in the model code as well as food allergen information in its annexes. The 2017 Food Code specifies the following information pertaining to food allergens:\n\n* A definition of \"major food allergen,\" which is consistent with the definition in section 201(qq) of the FD&C Act (Paragraph 1-201.10(B)).\n* Demonstration, the person in charge of a food establishment shall have an understanding of the foods identified as major food allergens and the symptoms that a major food allergen could cause in a sensitive individual (Subparagraph 2-102.11(C)(9)).

How can the MAH (a) avoid repeating data in sections 15 and 16 and (b) provide sufficient detail to substantiate conclusions?",
    "Answer": "(a) Points to Consider in Avoiding Repetition in the PBRER\n\nAlthough repetition of information across different sections of the PBRER is not entirely avoidable and sometimes appropriate, the MAH can consider providing instructions to its staff in its internal templates/guidance documents to minimize such repetition. These instructions could recommend cross-referencing earlier sections of the PBRER in which the data were initially presented. However, the MAH should not overuse cross-referencing, because this could prevent a clear message from being conveyed to the reader.\n\nSections 6 through 14 of the PBRER are intended to present only the data or findings from the various sources covered by these sections. In contrast, sections 15 and 16 are intended to present the relevant interpretation and evaluation of the significant data and findings from sections 6 through 14.\n\n_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nFor example, if the MAH identifies a new and ongoing signal based on a literature report published during the reporting interval, the MAH should summarize the literature report in section 11 (Literature) and the identified safety signal should be included in the summary tabulation in section 15 (Overview of Signals). If the MAH refutes an ongoing safety signal based on the results of a randomized clinical trial completed during the reporting interval, then the MAH should briefly summarize the relevant study findings in section 7.1 (Completed Clinical Trials). In addition, the MAH should update the status of the signal in the section 15 signal tabulation, as well as provide a critical analysis of new and cumulative data in section 16.2 (Signal Evaluation). This integrated analysis should include the MAH's rationale and conclusions for refuting the signal. The analysis of the refuted signal discussed in section 16.2 should not completely repeat the findings included in section 7.1 but should instead provide a high-level summary that focuses on the evaluation and interpretation of these findings. Similarly, the summary analyses included in sections 16.2 and 16.3 should not be repeated in section 16.4 (Characterization of Risks) of the PBRER.\n\nAppendix C of the E2C(R2) guidance provides a format for signal tabulation, including two examples; Appendix F provides further guidance on mapping signals and risks to the appropriate PBRER sections.\n\n**(b) Points to Consider in Providing Sufficient Detail in Sections 15 and 16 of the PBRER**\n\n**General Considerations:**\n\nAs described in section II.E (2.5) of the guidance, the MAH should tailor the level of detail it provides for both the presentation of findings (sections 6 through 14) and evaluation sections (sections 15 and 16) based upon the clinical significance of the presented findings; this involves medical and scientific judgment. The level of detail should be sufficient to substantiate the MAH's conclusions and any actions taken or proposed. In these sections, the MAH should discuss in greater detail any findings that have a substantial medical impact or call for a more in-depth evaluation of causality.\n\n**Considerations for Specific Sections:**\n\n**Section 15: Overview of Signals**\n\nThe MAH should provide in a summary table an overview of signals ongoing and closed in the reporting interval. Appendix C of the guidance provides an example summary table that contains information at a high level, as opposed to detailed data. For signals closed during the reporting interval, the MAH should supplement the information appearing in the table with a summary evaluation of available data in section 16.2. When a regulatory authority has requested that a specific topic (not considered a signal) be monitored and reported in a PBRER, the MAH should summarize the result of the analysis in this section if it is negative.\n\n"

    "Question": "After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, For foreign clinical studies conducted under an IND, how can an investigator sign the 1572 when the investigator knows he/she cannot commit to all of the requirements on the form, specifically IRB membership (21 CFR 56.107)?",
    "Answer": "IRB review and approval is required before a clinical study can be initiated under an IND (21 CFR 56.103(a)). FDA may waive any of the IRB requirements for specific research activities or for classes of research activities otherwise covered by the IRB regulations (21 CFR 56.105), but FDA uses the waiver provision only when alternative mechanisms for ensuring protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects are acceptable. The most common circumstance for which FDA receives a waiver request is when a sponsorwishes to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. In this case, typically an Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) that operates in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) is utilized instead of a U.S. IRB. Although its membership and functions for assuring human subject protection are comparable to an IRB, an IEC may not meet all of the IRB requirements contained in 21 CFR Part 56.\n\nFor a foreign study, an IRB waiver request should contain a description of alternative mechanisms for assuring human subject protection. It would generally be acceptable for a waiver request to state the intention to use an IEC that complies with GCP (e.g., ICH E6) instead of an IRB that complies with 21 CFR Part 56.\n\nThe sponsor should submit the waiver request to the IND under which the study will be conducted. The IND will have been submitted to the appropriate review division in either the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) or the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).\n\nThe sponsor will be informed by the agency in writing whether the waiver request is denied or granted. If a waiver is granted, the sponsor should have investigators attach a copy of the letter granting the waiver to the signed 1572 in the investigator's record."

    "Question": "This question is about Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators Must an investigator's brochure be included in the documentation when an IRB reviews an investigational drug study?",
    "Answer": "For studies conducted under an investigational new drug application, an investigator's brochure is usually required by FDA [21 CFR 312.23(a)(5) and 312-55]. Even though 21 CFR part 56 does not mention the investigator's brochure by name, much of the information contained in such brochures is clearly required to be reviewed by the IRB. The regulations do outline the criteria for IRB approval of research. 21 CFR 56.111(a)(1) requires the IRB to assure that risks to the subjects are minimized. 21 CFR 56.111(a)(2) requires the IRB to assure that the risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits. The risks cannot be adequately evaluated without review of the results of previous animal and human studies, which are summarized in the investigator's brochure.\n\nThere is no specific regulatory requirement that the Investigator's Brochure be submitted to the IRB. There are regulatory requirements for submission of information which normally is included in the Investigator's Brochure. It is common that the Investigator's Brochure is submitted to the IRB, and the IRB may establish written procedures which require its submission. Investigator's Brochures may be part of the investigational plan that the IRB reviews when reviewing medical device studies."

(5.7)",
    "Answer": "For non-mutagenic related substances, the ICH Q3A identification threshold serves to identify the level above which a related substance is considered to have an impact on the impurity profile of the drug substance. A related substance with an acceptance criterion above the ICH Q3A identification threshold is considered to impact the drug substance impurity profile.\n\nFor mutagenic impurities, the 30 percent threshold of the ICH M7 acceptable limit serves to identify the level above which a mutagenic impurity is considered to have an impact on the impurity profile of the drug substance. In this situation, the control strategy will generally include a test for the impurity at the acceptable limit (see section 8 of ICH M7). Any of the approaches described in section 8 of ICH M7 can be used to determine which impurities are likely to be present in the drug substance above the 30 percent threshold.\n\nIn line with ICH M7 and ICH S9, there are situations (e.g., when the drug substance is itself genotoxic, and other circumstances as described in these guidances) when the selection of the starting material for a drug substance does not need to specifically consider the mutagenic impurity profile at the levels described above. In such cases, mutagenic impurities are not considered to impact the impurity profile of the drug substance unless they are above the ICH Q3A identification threshold. Impurities that persist through multiple steps of the manufacturing process should be considered in conjunction with Q&A 5.8."

    "Answer": "Yes, with two exceptions. The first is that the FDA requirements for IRBs under 21 CFR Part 56 are slightly different with respect to membership and function. To address this issue, as described in #12 above, FDA can provide a specific waiver from the Part 56 IRB requirements, allowing an IEC that complies with good clinical practice to substitute for the IRB.4 The second exception is that the requirements for informed consent under 21 CFR Part 50 for particular clinical trials (e.g., emergency research under 21 CFR 50.24, clinical investigations involving pediatric subjects under Subpart D) are more extensive with respect to IRB responsibilities. Because these types of trials are uncommon, our experience has not revealed that this has caused a conflict; but in the event of one, we would be willing to discuss a resolution with the sponsor on a case-by-case basis.

    "Answer": "The intensity of late phase ECG monitoring will be dependent upon the quality and extent of the nonclinical and clinical evaluation. In situations where it is not possible to study higher exposures than are anticipated with the intended marketed dose, more intensive ECG monitoring might be necessary during phase 3 trials. When the nonclinical and early clinical data do not suggest clinically relevant QTc prolongation, intensive late stage monitoring might not be necessary.

The titles only consist of the word \"Estradiol\" followed by a series of \"1\"s, which doesn't give any specific information about their content., What is the background of this guidance?",
    "Answer": "The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA)3 requires all Federal agencies to assess the environmental impact of their actions and to ensure that the interested and affected public is informed of the environmental analyses. To comply with NEPA, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers the environmental impacts of its actions as an integral part of its regulatory process. FDA regulations at 21 CFR part 25 specify that EAs must be submitted as part of certain NDAs, abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), biologic license applications (BLAs), supplements to such applications, and investigational new drug applications (INDs), as well as for various other actions, unless the action qualifies for a categorical exclusion. Failure to submit either an EA or a claim of categorical exclusion is sufficient grounds for FDA to refuse to file or approve an application (21 CFR 25.15(a), 314.101(d)(4), and 601.2(a) and (c)).\n\nCategorical exclusions for actions related to human drugs and biologics are listed at 21 CFR 25.31. This guidance focuses on the categorical exclusion for actions on NDAs and NDA supplements that would increase the use of an active moiety, but the estimated concentration of the substance at the point of entry into the aquatic environment would be below 1 part per billion (1 ppb) (21 CFR 25.31(b)). Although an action that qualifies for this exclusion ordinarily does not require an EA, FDA will require \"at least an EA\" if \"extraordinary circumstances\" indicate that the specific proposed action (e.g., the approval of the NDA) may significantly affect the quality of the human environment (21 CFR 25.21).4 One example of extraordinary circumstances provided in FDA's regulations is an action for which available data establish that, at the expected level of exposure, there is the potential for serious harm to the environment (21 CFR 25.21(a)).\n\nConsistent with these regulations, when the sponsor of an NDA or NDA supplement5 submits a claim of categorical exclusion under 21 CFR 25.31(b), FDA considers whether extraordinary circumstances exist under 21 CFR 25.21. If extraordinary circumstances exist, FDA will require the sponsor to submit an EA. If FDA needs more information to determine whether extraordinary circumstances exist, FDA may ask the sponsor to submit additional information concerning the potential environmental effects of approval of the sponsor's application or supplement. In light of research indicating that drugs with endocrine-related activity and, more specifically, drugs with E, A, or T activity, have the potential to cause developmental or reproductive effects in the aquatic environment at concentrations below 1 ppb,6 FDA has, on a case-by-case basis, requested additional information from sponsors to help it determine whether extraordinary circumstances exist. However, late cycle requests for additional environmental information have the potential to delay approval of applications. Accordingly, this guidance is intended to clarify that sponsors of drugs with potential E, A, or T activity should consult with the Agency early in product development concerning the information FDA may need to determine whether an EA will be required or whether a claim of categorical exclusion will be acceptable, and what information should be included in the EA or claim of categorical exclusion."

    "Answer": "Section 7002(e)(4) states that an \"approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the [FD&C Act]\" will be deemed to be a BLA on the transition date. Accordingly, FDA interprets the statute to mean that an approved NDA for a biological product that has been discontinued from marketing, but for which FDA has not withdrawn approval of the application, will be deemed to be a BLA on the transition date. The holder of an NDA for a discontinued product must comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements for its application before the transition date, and after its application is deemed to be a BLA. These requirements include, for example, postmarketing reporting of adverse drug experiences and, if appropriate, the submission of proposed revisions to product labeling. If the holder of a deemed BLA for a biological product that has been discontinued from marketing seeks to reintroduce the product to the market, the BLA holder should consult with the relevant FDA review division before submitting a supplement to the deemed BLA, to discuss any data and information that may be needed."

    "Question": "As described in Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, How do I determine if the study is a significant or non-significant risk study under 21 CFR 812.2(b)?",
    "Answer": "A significant risk IVD device is generally one that is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to health, safety, or welfare of a subject. 21 CFR 812.3(m).\n\nFor IVDs, we interpret \"potential for serious risk\" in relation to the nature of the harm that may result to the subject. Misdiagnosis and/or error in treatment caused by inaccurate test results would be considered a significant risk if the potential harm to the subject could be life-threatening, or could result in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to the body structure.\n\nFalse positive results can lead to unnecessary confirmatory testing, unnecessary treatment that can be invasive or have harmful side effects, and/or unnecessary psychological trauma when serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions are involved. False negative results can lead to a delay in establishing the correct diagnosis, failure to start or continue needed treatment, false security that may prevent timely follow-up and retesting, and contribute to the potential spread of infectious agents to others.

    "Question": "When considering the information from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Why does ICH Q7 permit the use of a packaging system for reserve/retention samples that is \"more protective than the marketed packaging system\" (ICH Q7, paragraph 11.72)?",
    "Answer": "Unlike stability samples, the purpose of the reserve/retention sample is not to represent the quality of the batch in the market place but to allow future evaluation of the quality of the original API batch (e.g., in evaluation of potential counterfeits). Therefore, reserve/retention samples may be stored in packaging (and conditions) that better preserve the original state of the API."

    "Question": "In accordance with E5 Ethnic Factors in the Acceptability of Foreign Clinical Data , What should be considered when planning a study intended to serve as a bridging study?",
    "Answer": "The multi-regional trial would have to satisfy requirements of the region where the application is to be filed with respect to design and analysis (see answer to Q1). In general, a multi-regional study should be designed with sufficient numbers of subjects so that there is adequate power to have a reasonable likelihood of showing an effect in each region of interest. Minor differences in design (e.g., age inclusion criteria, concomitant medication, etc.) may be acceptable and prior discussion with regulatory agencies is encouraged. For safety evaluation, it is important to make as uniform as possible the method for collection and assessment of safety information among regions."

    "Question": "As outlined in Guidance for Industry- Food Allergen Labeling Exemption Petitions and Notifications , May a \"Contains\" statement on a food label provide only the names of the food sources of the major food allergens that are not already identified in the ingredient list for a packaged food?",
    "Answer": "No. If a \"Contains\" statement is used on a food label, the statement is to include the names of the food sources of all major food allergens used as ingredients in the packaged food (see section 403(w)(1) of the FD&C Act). For example, if sodium caseinate, whey, egg yolks, and natural peanut flavor are declared in a product's ingredients list, a \"Contains\" statement appearing on the label immediately after or adjacent to that statement is to identify all three food sources of the major food allergens present (e.g., \"Contains milk, egg, peanuts\") in the same type (i.e., print or font) size as that used for the ingredient list."

    "Question": "From what I've read in M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals , How are dosage, duration, and endpoint of a combination toxicity study selected?",
    "Answer": "ICH M3(R2) is intended primarily to address the timing and duration of nonclinical studies relative to clinical development. Provided a nonclinical combination toxicity study is warranted to support the combination clinical trial, the duration of the study should be equivalent to that of the clinical trial it is intended to support, up to a maximum of 90 days (which would also support marketing). A combination study of shorter duration can be used to support marketing, depending on the duration of clinical use. A combination toxicity study intended to address a particular cause for toxicological concern, based on the experience with the individual agents, should be of a duration that is appropriate to address the concern. The combination toxicity study should incorporate endpoints to evaluate additive and synergistic effects for known toxicities that might be predicted from what is known of the pharmacological, toxicological, and pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of the individual entities, as well as the available clinical data, and standard endpoints typically used in a general toxicity study. Detailed discussion of experimental design (e.g., choice of species, dose and dosing frequency justifications) is outside the scope of this guidance. However, dosages should be appropriate to address any identified cause for concern or to provide exposure margins that are clinically relevant (e.g., when conducting a study with two early stage agents)."

Does this mean that the new regions should accept all indications without further data?",
    "Answer": "No. Whether or not the new region will require further data would be decided on a case-by-case basis, depending on whether the \"bridged\" indication was thought to satisfy all concerns about potential ethnic differences. For example, the additional indications might be extensions of the primary indication (perhaps not calling for an additional bridging study) or quite new uses (perhaps calling for bridging).

The original intent of this definition in ICH Q7 was that expired API should not be used in drug product formulation. It may be acceptable to reprocess (ICH Q7, section XIV.B (14.2)) or rework (ICH Q7, section XIV.C (14.3)) the expired API where the API manufacturer has all related historical GMP documentation and additional stability data on the reworked or reprocessed API.

(1.1)",
    "Answer": "The document recommends that the reader should be skilled, but it does not identify specific training that is needed. A technician reading with a cardiologist over-reading the document would certainly be consistent with the guidance. The attempt of the guidance to limit the number of readers represents an attempt to increase consistency. The guidance asks for assessment of intra- and inter-reader variability and suggests \"a few skilled readers\" (not necessarily a single reader) to analyze a whole thorough QT study, since many readers may increase variability. Training would be another way to improve consistency.\n\nIt is recommended for the thorough QT Study that core ECG laboratories blind subject, time, and treatment in order to reduce potential bias. The T wave analysis, which calls for all 12 leads, can be performed after the QT analyses, and requires comparison to the baseline ECG; it can, however, be blinded as to treatment."

Sponsors may ship investigational devices only to qualified investigators participating in the clinical investigation (21 CFR 812.43(b)). Sponsors must also maintain complete, current, and accurate records pertaining to the shipment and disposition of the investigational device (21 CFR 812.140(b)(2)). Records of shipment shall include the name and address of the consignee, type and quantity of device, date of shipment, and batch number or code mark. Records of disposition shall describe the batch number or code marks of any devices returned to the sponsor, repaired, or disposed of in other ways by the investigator or another person, and the reasons for and method of disposal.\n\nTo further ensure compliance with these requirements, sponsors should take appropriate measures to instruct investigators regarding their responsibilities with respect to recordkeeping and device disposition. The specific recordkeeping requirements for investigators are set forth at 21 CFR 812.140(a). Upon completion or termination of a clinical investigation (or the investigator's part of an investigation), or at the sponsor's request, an investigator is required to return to the sponsor any remaining supply of the device or otherwise to dispose of the device as the sponsor directs (21 CFR 812.110(e))."

Is this statement a waiver of the subject's legal right to privacy?",
    "Answer": "No. FDA does not require any subject to \"waive\" a legal right. Rather, FDA requires that subjects be informed that complete privacy does not apply in the context of research involving FDA regulated products. Under the authority of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, FDA may inspect and copy clinical records to verify information submitted by a sponsor. FDA generally will not copy a subject's name during the inspection unless a more detailed study of the case is required or there is reason to believe that the records do not represent the actual cases studied or results obtained. The consent document should not state or imply that FDA needs clearance or permission from the clinical investigator, the subject or the IRB for such access. When clinical investigators conduct studies for submission to FDA, they agree to allow FDA access to the study records, as outlined in 21 CFR 312.68 and 812.145. Informed consent documents should make it clear that, by participating in research, the subject's records automatically become part of the research database. Subjects do not have the option to keep their records from being audited/reviewed by FDA. When an individually identifiable medical record (usually kept by the clinical investigator, not by the IRB) is copied and reviewed by the Agency, proper confidentiality procedures are followed within FDA.

If IS responses of subject samples in the repeat analysis are again not within the range for those of Cals/QCs (i.e., differences in IS responses in the original run are reproducible), and repeat analyte concentrations are still comparable to the original values, additional data might be needed to demonstrate that the differences in sample matrices (i.e., matrices for subject samples vs. matrices for Cals/QCs) do not impact the accuracy of the analyte concentration measurements. The approach(es) for investigation might include, but are not limited to, an analysis of QCs prepared in pre-dose matrix of individual impacted subjects, serial dilution of impacted subject samples using the matrices used to prepare Cals/QCs, or any other scientifically justified approach."

    "Question": "As described in ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , In cases where an intermediate bulk material is identical between the various strengths (dose proportional blends, bulk solutions, etc.), is it sufficient to perform stability on one lot of each strength, when each strength is produced from a separate intermediate bulk?",
    "Answer": "No. For ANDAs that contain multiple strengths (that are dose proportional), three separate intermediate bulk granulations (or blends) should be manufactured. One batch of bulk granulation (or blend) should be used to manufacture all the strengths proposed. The other two bulk granulations (or blends) can be used to manufacture only the lowest and the highest strengths, in addition to the strength used in BE studies (i.e., the strength(s) tested in the BE studies should have three batches). Stability testing should still use all three batches of drug product."

If different synthesizers (methods of synthesis) are used, three batches from each method of synthesis at or near the upper end of the proposed radio-concentration are recommended. Batches do not have to be made in the same facility. For any additional manufacturing facilities, applicants should provide stability data on at least one batch at or near the upper end of the proposed radio-concentration from each facility, although bracketing approaches may be submitted for review.

    "Question": "After reviewing Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) Appeals Processes Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What is a \"Significant Decision\"?",
    "Answer": "The documentation and review procedures required by section 517A of the FD&C Act apply only to \"significant decisions\" concerning submissions under sections 510(k) (Premarket Notification), 515 (Premarket Approval or \"PMA\"/Humanitarian Device Exemption or \"HDE\"), 515B (Breakthrough Devices), or 520(g) (Investigational Device Exemption or \"IDE\") of the FD&C Act. \"Significant decision\" is not explicitly defined in section 517A of the FD&C Act. For purposes of this guidance, we refer to \"significant decisions\" made by CDRH that are within the scope of section 517A as \"517A decisions.\" Therefore, a request for supervisory review of a 517A decision must follow the procedures and timeframes set forth in section 517A(b) of the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations found in 21 CFR 800.75. As stated in 21 CFR 800.75, 517A decisions include the following types of decisions:\n\n* 510(k) (Premarket Notification): Not Substantially Equivalent; Substantially Equivalent;\n* PMA/HDE (Premarket Approval/Humanitarian Device Exemption): Not Approvable; Approvable; Approval; Denial;\n* Breakthrough Device Designation Request4: Request for breakthrough designation for devices subject to 510(k), PMA, or De Novo classification. Grant; Denial of request for breakthrough designation; Footnote 4: Breakthrough Devices Program \u2013 Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, available at: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/breakthrough-devices-program.\n* IDE (Investigational Device Exemption): Disapproval; Approval;\n* Failure to Reach Agreement on a Protocol under Section 520(g)(7) of the FD&C Act; and\n* \"Clinical Hold\" Determinations under Section 520(g)(8) of the FD&C Act.\n\nUnder 21 CFR 800.75, the timeframes and procedures specified in section 517A of the FD&C Act for 517A decisions regarding premarket submissions apply to sequential requests for supervisory review of such decisions within CDRH. For example, if a company that requests supervisory review of a 517A decision at the Office level further appeals the Office decision to the next higher level, FDA would apply the procedures and timeframes specified in section 517A of the FD&C Act to both of these appeals.\n\nThere are regulatory actions that do not constitute 517A decisions for purposes of 21 CFR_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\n800.75 and thus are not subject to 21 CFR 800.75(b)(1). These types of appeals are subject to 21 CFR 10.75 and 21 CFR 800.75(b)(2). CDRH refers to these decisions as \"non-517A decisions\". Examples of non-517A decisions include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n* 510(k) Requests for Additional Information;\n* De Novo Requests for Additional Information and Final Decisions;\n* PMA Major Deficiency Letters;\n* 510(k), PMA and HDE Refuse to Accept/Refuse to File Letters;\n* Postmarket Surveillance Orders under Section 522 of the FD&C Act;\n* Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) Waiver Decisions;\n* Warning Letters; and\n* Response Letter to a Request for Information under Section 513(g) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThese requests for supervisory review would not trigger the requirements under section 517A of the FD&C Act.\n\nNote that the requirements for non-517A decisions within 21 CFR 10.75 and 21 CFR\n\n800.75(b)(2) also apply to sequential requests for supervisory review of such decisions within CDRH. As such, a request for supervisory review within CDRH under 21 CFR 10.75 for a non-517A decision that is not received by CDRH within 60 days after the date of the decision involved will be denied as untimely, unless CDRH, for good cause related to circumstances\n\nbeyond the control of the submitter, such as snow emergency, Federal Government shutdown, or other unforeseen emergency event, permits the request to be filed after 60 days5.\n\nFootnote 5: 21 CFR 800.75(b)(2)"

    "Answer": "When a thorough QTc study of usual or modified design is not feasible, the intensity of late phase ECG monitoring will be dependent upon the quality and extent of the nonclinical and clinical evaluation. In situations where it is not possible to study higher exposures than are anticipated with the intended marketed dose, more intensive ECG monitoring might be necessary during phase 3 trials. When the nonclinical and early clinical data do not suggest clinically relevant QTc prolongation, intensive late stage monitoring might not be necessary. Otherwise, monitoring could be conducted as if a thorough QT study had been positive to protect patients in later trials and to obtain information on the frequency of marked QTc prolongation in the patient population (see Question Q16 (7.1))."

Please clarify whether the narrative to be included in 2.7.3.2 should include the safety results as well as \"enough detail to allow the reviewer to understand the exposure... and how safety data were collected\" or whether the results should be included in Section 2.7.4.1.1.",
    "Answer": "In general, safety results should be described in section 2.7.4.1.1, because section Summary of Clinical Efficacy 2.7.3 is devoted to efficacy. To avoid the need to describe the same study twice, section 2.7.3.2 asks for a reasonably complete description of studies pertinent to both safety and efficacy, including, in study narratives, information about the extent of exposure of study subjects to the test drug and how safety data were collected. This approach is confirmed in section 2.7.4.1.1, which notes that narratives for studies contributing both safety and efficacy data should be included in section 2.7.3.2. As noted in section Background and Overview of Clinical Efficacy 2.7.3.1, however, any results of these studies that are pertinent to evaluation of safety should be discussed in section Summary of Clinical Safety 2.7.4."

    "Question": "In accordance with Distribution of In Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only or Investigational Use Only Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, What types of instrumentation can manufacturers promote for use with LDTs?",
    "Answer": "ASRs are intended to be sold as building blocks for use in design of a diagnostic test by the test developer. If an ASR is promoted as being intended for use with a particular instrument, FDA would not view the promoted product as an ASR. Use of the ASR with the particular instrument would be a design choice by the ASR manufacturer and not by the test developer. As a result, manufacturers should not promote specific laboratory instruments for use in conjunction with particular ASRs.\n\nIn contrast, open instruments that have user-defined capabilities, which allow the user to select an instrument and an ASR independently, and define, optimize, and validate the test performance characteristics and interpretation criteria, may be promoted for use generally in LDTs (e.g., spectrophotometers, HPLC). If instrumentation is used for an ASR-based test, the laboratory should be able to select the instrumentation and validate the performance of the LDT on that instrument."

'Subinvestigator' includes any other individual member of that team.\" 21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(viii) requires the investigator to provide \"a list of the names of the subinvestigators (e.g., research fellows, residents) who will be assisting the investigator in the conduct of the investigation(s).\"\n\nThe purpose of Section #6 is to capture information about individuals who, as part of an investigative team, will assist the investigator and make a direct and significant contribution to the data. The decision to list an individual in Section #6 depends on his/her level of responsibility (i.e., whether he/she is performing significant clinical investigation-related duties). In general, if an individual is directly involved in the performance of procedures required by the protocol, and the collection of data, that person should be listed on the 1572.

    "Question": "Upon checking the information in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Does FDA require the informed consent document to contain a space for assent by children?",
    "Answer": "No, however, many investigators and IRBs consider it standard practice to obtain the agreement of older children who can understand the circumstances before enrolling them in research. While the FDA regulations do not specifically address enrollment of children (other than to include them as a class of vulnerable subjects), the basic requirement of 21 CFR 50.20 applies, i.e., the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative must be obtained before enrollment. Parents, legal guardians and/or others may have the ability to give permission to enroll children in research, depending on applicable state and local law of the jurisdiction in which the research is conducted. (Note: permission to enroll in research is not the same as permission to provide medical treatment.) IRBs generally require investigators to obtain the permission of one or both of the parents or guardian (as appropriate) and the assent of children who possess the intellectual and emotional ability to comprehend the concepts involved. Some IRBs require two documents, a fully detailed explanation for parents and older children to read and sign, and a shorter, simpler one for younger children. [For research supported by DHHS, the additional protections at 45 CFR 46 Subpart D are also required. The Subpart D regulations provide appropriate guidance for all other pediatric studies.] On April 24, 2001, FDA issued an interim final rule, Additional Protections for Children, as subpart D to 21 CFR Part 50.

    "Answer": "The regulations in 21 CFR 1271.15, including 21 CFR 1271.15(b) provide exceptions from the requirements in Part 1271. The four criteria described in 21 CFR 1271.10(a) are assessed to determine whether an HCT/P that does not fall under any of the exceptions in 21 CFR 1271.15 is regulated solely under section 361 of the PHS Act and Part 1271. The assessment of whether the exception in 21 CFR 1271.15(b) applies is independent from the determination of whether the HCT/P meets the criteria in 21 CFR 1271.10(a) (e.g., the criteria of minimal manipulation in 21 CFR 1271.10(a)(1) and homologous use in 21 CFR 1271.10(a)(2) are not considered when determining whether an HCT/P meets the exception in 21 CFR 1271.15(b)). Further, the assessment of whether the exception in 21 CFR 1271.15(b) applies is made before considering the four criteria in 21 CFR 1271.10(a). Thus, if an establishment meets the exception in 21 CFR 1271.15(b), the establishment is excepted from the requirements under Part 1271 and the establishment need not consider whether that HCT/P meets the four criteria in 21 CFR 1271.10(a)."

    "Question": "Based on the information from Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , Are manufacturers and repackagers still required to include a linear barcode on their products?",
    "Answer": "Considering the product identifier requirements under the DSCSA, manufacturers and repackagers have asked FDA whether some of their products are still required under 21 CFR 201.25 to include a linear barcode. The linear barcode requirements were established for different purposes than the DSCSA requirements and apply to additional FDA-regulated products and packaging in some instances, and are still in effect. In the _Federal Register_ of February 26, 2004 (69 FR 9120), FDA published a final rule requiring certain human drug and biological product labels to have a linear barcode that contains, at a minimum, the drug's NDC number (SS 201.25).18 Manufacturers, repackers (also known as \"repackagers\"), relabelers, and private label distributors of human prescription drug products, biological products, and over-the-counter (OTC) drug products dispensed pursuant to an order and commonly used in hospitals, are subject to the linear barcode requirement. The linear barcode must appear on the drug's label as defined by section 201(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(k)). FDA has interpreted that requirement to mean the linear barcode should be on the outside container or wrapper, as well as on the immediate container unless the barcode is readily visible and machine-readable through the outside container or wrapper.19"

However, the rate of these events is clearly different in the new region, even though the pathophysiology is the same. Does E5 indicate that the new region should accept those data as pivotal evidence of efficacy?",
    "Answer": "No. Certainly, in most cases where there is a definitive outcome study in another region, a region would probably not require that the study be repeated locally. There could, however, be exceptions; for example, if the event rate is indeed lower in the new region, and the risk reduction is the same in both regions, the actual number of patients benefited will be smaller and an adverse effect could become more important, affecting the benefit-to-risk relationship of the drug. A new region, in some cases, might need a clinical trial to assess the value of the drug."

    "Answer": "\"Completely distributed\" refers to the distribution of the entire batch of the API by the API manufacturer to the next party in the supply chain. It should be noted that this 3-year retention of reserve/retention samples applies to all parties that physically process or repackage the API (ICH Q7, see Glossary (section 20) for definition of _manufacture_).\n\nThe intent of ICH Q7 is that samples be retained for the period of time that the API could be in the market in order to investigate any problems and/or product complaints. Based on accepted industry practice at the time ICH Q7 was written, it was not anticipated that a manufacturer would set a retest date longer than 3 years. It is a basic GMP principle that reserve samples be retained for the entire period the material is available on the market. For example, if a company sets a retest date of 5 years and the API is completely distributed immediately after manufacturing, it is not intended that the reserve sample be destroyed before the 5-year retest date is reached."

    "Answer": "It is important that the peer-review process be well documented and transparent. When either a contemporaneous or a retrospective pathology peer review is part of a GLP toxicology study, the activity should be included in the study protocol or protocol amendment. The process should be guided by written procedures to establish the extent of the review and ensure the integrity of the study. Because the study pathologist is responsible for the overall pathology data, the pathology report will reflect the study pathologist's best scientific opinion and judgment regarding the diagnoses and pathological interpretations.\n\nPathology peer review should be planned, conducted, documented, and reported in accordance with established written procedures. These written procedures should be available to the peer-review pathologist(s) prior to the initiation of peer review as SOPs, or in the study protocol or study-protocol amendment.\n\nThe peer-review pathologist(s) should generate a signed and dated peer-review statement (document, report, memorandum, or certificate) for inclusion in the final study report. All peer-review pathologists' signature blocks (identity and affiliation) should be included in the peer-review statement that is contained in the final study report.\n\nThe peer-review statement should be signed and dated by the peer-review pathologist(s) and include the following information:\n\n* Who performed the peer-review and the date(s) it was performed\n* Whether the peer-review was performed contemporaneously or retrospectively\n* Whether the peer-review was conducted in compliance with GLP regulations\n* What tissues were examined microscopically, corresponding animal identification number, dose/treatment group, and the basis for their selection\n* What format (e.g., glass slides or whole slide images) was used_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nWhether the terminology, diagnoses, and interpretations used in the pathology report were agreed upon by both the study and peer-review pathologist(s)\n\nWhether a narrative report prepared by the study pathologist was reviewed either prior to or during peer review (for contemporaneous review only)\n\nWhat data and documents were utilized during the peer review (a listing)\n\nIf the peer-review pathologist concurs with the diagnoses and interpretations of the study pathologist, the peer-review statement might not include a comprehensive analysis of the outcome of the peer review. Under these conditions, sponsors or applicants can submit a statement explaining that a peer review was conducted, and the final pathology report reflects the consensus opinions of the study pathologist and peer-review pathologist(s). If no resolution of differences in diagnoses and interpretations can be reached during pathology peer review, the study pathologist and peer-review pathologist should carefully follow a transparent and unbiased process that is clearly described in written procedures (i.e., SOPs, study protocol, or study protocol amendment) for addressing diagnostic and interpretative differences during pathology peer review (as discussed further in Q9).\n\nAny changes to the diagnoses and interpretations by the study pathologist as a result of a contemporaneous peer review do not need to be documented in the study pathology report, as contemporaneous peer review is considered part of the iterative diagnostic pathology process. Any changes to the diagnoses and interpretations by the study pathologist as a result of a retrospective peer-review should be documented in the peer-review statement and in an amendment to the study pathologist's report."

    "Question": "As stated in Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Are the sugars used in the production of vinegar added sugars?",
    "Answer": "In the production of vinegar, naturally occurring sugars are first fermented into alcohol and then a secondary fermentation occurs in which alcohol is converted to vinegar. For most vinegar products, no sugars remain in the final product. Vinegars that do not contain any sugars in the finished food would not need an added sugars declaration. However, we are aware of some vinegars (e.g., balsamic vinegar) that are made using ingredients that are often used as sweeteners in foods, and that are similar to concentrated fruit juices (e.g., grape must). According to the definition of added sugars, sugars found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type are added sugars. Therefore, fruit juices that are concentrated before or during processing of some vinegars contain sugars that are consistent with our definition of added sugars. To the extent that sugars that meet our definition of added sugars are present in the finished product, the added sugars must be declared on the label and in labeling, as required in our Nutrition Facts label final rule. We understand that the manufacturing of vinegar involves several steps, and manufacturers need to consider the impact of these steps (e.g. potential concentration due to water loss when aged in wooden barrels) on the final added sugars declaration."

    "Question": "As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Does the phrase \"grouping of containers\" have the same meaning in ICH Q7, paragraphs 7.20 and 7.24?",
    "Answer": "The phrase \"grouping of containers\" should be read in the context of each sentence. A grouping of containers refers to multiple containers physically secured by the supplier (e.g., shrink-wrapped pallet) usually intended for ease of shipment and reconciliation. ICH Q7, paragraph 7.20 is referring to incoming visual examination of materials before acceptance into the facility under quarantine.\n\nThe phrase in ICH Q7, paragraph 7.24, \"grouping of containers (batches)\" contains an additional word \"batches\" because this section is addressing establishment of batch traceability for the incoming material."

    "Question": "With reference to Oversight of Clinical Investigations \u2014 A Risk-Based Approach to Monitoring Guidance for Industry, How should sponsors follow up on significant issues identified through monitoring, including communication of such issues?",
    "Answer": "Significant issues should be thoroughly evaluated in a timely manner at the appropriate levels (for example, sponsor, clinical sites) as described in the monitoring plan. A root cause analysis followed by appropriate corrective and preventive actions should be undertaken promptly to reduce the impact of the identified issue on the rights, safety, and welfare of participants in the clinical investigation and/or the integrity of the data. Additionally, the risk assessment and monitoring plan should be reviewed and revised, as needed, to help ensure the risk of recurrence is decreased, or if possible, eliminated. In instances in which corrective actions modify study processes, the protocol and/or associated investigational plans should be amended to reflect changed processes. Related systemic issues should be identified and resolved promptly to help ensure that investigation quality, including the rights, safety, and welfare of investigation participants and data integrity, is maintained.\n\nExamples of preventive and corrective actions that may be warranted include but are not limited to (1) improved training for the clinical investigator and site staff; (2) halting enrollment at a clinical site pending resolution of identified issues; (3) clarifying or revising the protocol and/or other related investigational plans and documents; and/or (4) modifying vendor service agreements to ensure adequate trial support.\n\nSignificant issues identified through monitoring and oversight activities and the actions to be taken should be documented and communicated to the appropriate parties, which may include, but are not limited to (1) sponsor management; (2) sponsor teams; (3) clinical sites; (4) institutional review boards; (5) other relevant parties (for example, DMCs and relevant contract research organizations); and (6) applicable regulatory agencies, including FDA, when appropriate.\n\nSee the 2013 RBM guidance for additional recommendations regarding follow-up and communication of significant issues identified via monitoring."

    "Question": "Looking at the guidelines in Distribution of In Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only or Investigational Use Only Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, What does the ASR rule require?",
    "Answer": "The rule classifies most ASRs as Class I devices subject to general controls under section 513(a)(1)(A) of the Act, but exempt from premarket notification. The general controls require ASR manufacturers to register and list their devices, 21 CFR 807.20(a), submit medical device reports (21 CFR Part 803), follow labeling requirements, 21 CFR 809.10(e), and follow cGMPs, 21 CFR 809.20(b). The rule also restricts the sale, use, distribution, labeling, advertising and promotion of ASRs. 21 CFR 809.30. One of these restrictions allows only physicians and other persons authorized by applicable State law to order LDTs that are developed using ASRs. 21 CFR 809.30(f). Another restriction requires the laboratory that develops an LDT using an ASR to add a statement disclosing that the laboratory developed the test and it has not been cleared or approved by FDA when reporting the test result to the practitioner. 21 CFR 809.30(e).\n\nThe restrictions also prohibit advertising and promotional materials for ASRs from making any claims for clinical or analytical performance. 21 CFR 809.30(d)(4). Consistent with this restriction, the labeling for Class I, exempt ASRs must bear the statement, \"Analytic Specific Reagent. Analytical and performance characteristics are not established.\" 21 CFR 809.10(e)(1)(x). Manufacturers who wish to make analytical and/or clinical performance claims for a product should submit an application to FDA for premarket review rather than marketing the product as an ASR. For example, performance claims might include statements such as, \"This ASR can be used for quantification of [an analyte] to determine [a diagnosis]\"."

    "Question": "With reference to Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, What should be retained with respect to the whole slide image file? Should modified whole slide image files be retained?",
    "Answer": "The whole slide image files provided to the study pathologist for histopathological examination and/or provided to the peer review pathologist(s) for pathology peer review (i.e., files containing all image data captured by the scanner and documentation of any technical image processing modifications), referred to here as the original whole slide image files, should be retained if they are used to generate raw data. Specifically, any technical image processing modifications made to whole slide image files prior to being provided to the pathologist (e.g., smoothing, color manipulation) should be documented and retained. Technical image processing should not obscure elements captured from the glass slide (e.g., label, artifact).\n\nThe pathologist should not permanently alter the original whole slide image files. Nonpermanent adjustments made by the pathologist using the image viewing software during whole slide image evaluation (e.g., brightness, contrast, annotations) do not need to be documented or retained."

    "Question": "Given the context of M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals , In ICH M3(R2), section I.C Scope of the Guidance (1.3) states that \"[p]harmaceuals under development for indications in life-threatening or serious diseases (e.g., advanced cancer, resistant HIV infection, and congenital enzyme deficiency diseases) without current effective therapy also warrant a case-by-case approach to both the toxicological evaluation and clinical development in order to optimize and expedite drug development.\" Although not specifically stated in the combination section of M3(R2) (see section XVII (17)), it is generally accepted that combination toxicity studies on advanced cancer and HIV products are not warranted unless there is a specific cause for concern. Can this be confirmed? Would this also extend to hepatitis C virus (HCV) products, as discussed in the recently issued FDA draft guidance for industry on Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection: Developing Direct-Acting Antifral Agents for Treatment (September 2010),4 and to other therapeutic areas where \"cocktails\" of drugs are standard clinical practice?",
    "Answer": "It is accepted that combination toxicity studies on advanced cancer, tuberculosis, and HIV products are generally not warranted unless there is a specific cause for concern under clinically relevant conditions. Combination toxicity studies are also not generally warranted for antiviral agents for treatment of hepatitis C. There are other situations where combinations of drugs are standard clinical practice for serious or life-threatening conditions without current effective therapies, and a similar approach might also apply."

    "Question": "As described in Treatment Use of Investigational Drugs Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expanded access?",
    "Answer": "The terms expanded access, access, and treatment use are used interchangeably to refer to use of an investigational drug when the primary purpose is to diagnose, monitor, or treat a patient's disease or condition. The terms _compassionate use_ and _preamproval access_ are also occasionally used in the context of the use of an investigational drug to treat a patient. Although these terms have been used informally in the United States and are used outside the United States, they are not defined or described in FDA regulations. This has led to some confusion or lack of clarity about the meaning of the terms (e.g., whether they refer to all expanded access or a type of expanded access, such as individual patient expanded access). For this reason, the terms _compassionate use_ and _preamproval access_ will not be used in this document.\n\nThe main distinction between expanded access and the use of an investigational drug in the usual studies covered under an IND is that expanded access uses are not primarily intended to obtain information about the safety or effectiveness of a drug. Expanded access to an investigational drug can only be provided under a treatment IND or protocol (see Q8) if the sponsor is actively pursuing, with due diligence, marketing approval of the drug for the expanded access use.\n\nExpanded access, access, and treatment use may also refer to (1) use in situations when a drug has been withdrawn for safety reasons, but there exists a patient population for whom the benefits of the withdrawn drug continue to outweigh the risks; (2) use of a similar, but unapproved drug (e.g., foreign-approved drug product) to provide treatment during a drug shortage of the approved drug; (3) use of an approved drug where availability is limited by a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) for diagnostic, monitoring, or treatment purposes, by patients who cannot obtain the drug under the REMS; or (4) use for other reasons."

    "Question": "Upon checking the information in Treatment Use of Investigational Drugs Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, If a sponsor continues to provide its investigational drug for treatment use under its IND to a patient who was enrolled in a clinical trial, but who does not continue to meet inclusion criteria, is that considered expanded access (i.e., is the sponsor expected to make an expanded access submission to continue to provide the drug to that patient)?",
    "Answer": "In general, if a patient is already enrolled in a clinical trial (designed to further the development of or determine the safety and/or effectiveness of an investigational drug) and the patient's results are to be included in the analysis of the investigational drug, the continued treatment of that patient with the investigational drug is not considered expanded access, even if the patient does not continue to meet all the study inclusion criteria or the patient's treatment deviates from the study protocol. This is commonly known as a protocol exception and would be covered under the existing IND."

Thus, regardless of whether a jurisdiction has adopted the 2017 Food Code, the requirements of these laws apply to domestically manufactured or imported packaged foods regulated under the FD&C Act (see question B.1). FDA regulates all packaged foods except most meat, poultry, catfish, and certain processed egg products.

    "Question": "With reference to E5 Ethnic Factors in the Acceptability of Foreign Clinical Data , I believe that my drug is insensitive to ethnic factors and that drugs in its class have similar activity in all regions. However, the endpoints I studied and/or the control group I used were considered acceptable to the regions in which the studies were conducted but not to the new region. Does E5 indicate that the new region should accept those data as evidence of efficacy?",
    "Answer": "No. E5 indicates clearly that it applies only when the foreign clinical data address all the regulatory requirements of the new region, but come from a different region. E5 does not address the regulatory requirements of individual regions. If your choice of clinical endpoints or control group is not considered acceptable to the new region, and if you cannot convince regulators in that region otherwise, then E5 does not apply to this situation. Early discussion with regulators in regions where endpoints, control groups, inclusion criteria or diagnostic criteria might differ should be considered part of planning clinical studies to meet an individual region's requirements. In this situation, the regulatory authority in the new region may require you to conduct a study using agreed-upon criteria in the new region."

    "Answer": "The holder of a deemed BLA will be required to revise the product labeling (e.g., container labels, carton labeling, and prescribing information) so that biological products introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce on or after March 23, 2020, conform to labeling requirements for biological products regulated under section 351 of the PHS Act. However, FDA acknowledges that holders of deemed BLAs may need time to revise their labeling to conform to such requirements and may not be able to make these revisions until receiving the information provided in the letter sent from FDA on the transition date. Accordingly, based on our understanding that holders of deemed BLAs may need time toconform their products' labeling to BLA labeling requirements, FDA generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products marketed under a deemed BLA with labeling that does not conform to certain labeling requirements until March 23, 2025, provided that the labeling at issue complies with all other applicable labeling requirements (see section IV below for information about the Agency's compliance policy).

In the E14 guidance, however, it is recommended that outliers be categorized as \\(>450\\), \\(>480\\), and \\(>500\\) milliseconds (ms), regardless of gender. Can you say why there is no gender difference in the recommendation? (2.1)",
    "Answer": "The reasons for the lack of gender-specific criteria for outliers are based on observations and interpretations of a large number of detailed analyses of QT data from patient and healthy volunteer studies. When large quantities of data are compiled for both TQT and dedicated thorough QT studies, there is no evidence to suggest that there is an interaction between gender and either the placebo or active effects of a drug on the QT interval.

(7.2)",
    "Answer": "The industry is continually gaining experience with evaluating QT prolongation in clinical trials, contributing to the clarification of factors that are relevant in the interpretation of QTc data. Proper interpretation requires knowledge of the inherent precision and variability of the assay, including the amount of QTc prolongation that can occur as part of the normal random variability of the assay and/or the biological variability of the QTc in the population under investigation. Determination of the clinical relevance of observed changes further involves consideration of the results of nonclinical and clinical pharmacological assessments, as well as an evaluation of the relation of the size of the effect to exposure.\n\nFurthermore, the duration of the ECG assessments following drug administration, and specifically the extent of the concentration-time profiles covered by assessments in the dedicated QT study relative to the expected therapeutic exposure, should be considered. It is important to recognize that the timing of the QT assessment relative to peak drug concentrations or to the time of adverse effects or sudden death cannot always be known prospectively. Accordingly, interpretation of the data should also consider the relationship between the observed effect on the QTc interval and the timing of adverse events or proarrhythmic events observed during clinical development or in marketed use. It is appropriate to integrate these factors to inform judgment regarding the significance of the observed QT prolongation."

(7.3)",
    "Answer": "QTc prolongation in a control arm within a non-conventional design clinical study should be considered in the context of clinical proarrhythmic events observed in clinical development or in marketed use. Comparison to placebo in a randomized controlled study provides valuable information. However, the placebo effect on QTc should not be discounted. Current understanding is that in many, but not all, studies a small mean QTc increasing effect compared to placebo has been observed. The placebo effect on QTc cannot be definitively quantified as it may be variable in size and difficult to distinguish from normal assay or population variability. The typical magnitude of the placebo effect on QTc appears to be small (i.e., 1 to 3 msec) at clinically effective doses and is reduced at higher doses. Comparison of differences in site, observer, or equipment characteristics may be less important in placebo-controlled studies in assessing the overall drug effect. Data from placebo-controlled studies conducted in compliance with ICH E14 and S5(R3) guidance and including the same electrocardiographic endpoint, assessment time, and quality standards for concomitant drug use, show that the QT/QTc prolonging effect of most QTc-prolonging drugs falls within an interval of less than 10 msec compared to placebo. In a diversity of therapeutic areas and with many different drugs and doses tested, QT effects near 0.5% of the mean-used global average heart rate were typically >10 msec, and in general, compounds with a mean maximum prolongation of the QTc interval of 5 msec versus placebo were estimated to prolong the QTc interval by up to 15 msec with 90% probability. For this reason, a difference of 5 msec between a QT/QTc drug effect and placebo can still be judged as within the expected 90% upper confidence interval for the placebo difference, even if not determined with high precision. In a given clinical development, the magnitude of the placebo effect on QTc may be as much as 6 or 7 msec. Simulations based on a placebo effect of less than 3 msec indicate that a study using an average of 60 subjects per active treatment group (120 subjects in total) will have a >95% probability (for a two-sided \u03b1=0.05) of detecting a drug QTc prolongation of 10 msec."

    "Question": "Having read through Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances , Is a \"starting material\" as described in ICH Q11 the same as an \"API starting material\" as described in ICH Q7? (5.2)",
    "Answer": "Yes. ICH Q11 states that the GMP provisions described in ICH Q7 apply to each branch of the drug substance manufacturing process beginning with the first use of a \"starting material.\" ICH Q7 states that appropriate GMP (as defined in that guidances) should be applied to the manufacturing steps immediately after \"API starting materials\" are entered into the process (see ICH Q7 Q&A 1.1). Because ICH Q11 sets the applicability of ICH Q7 as beginning with the \"starting material,\" and ICH Q7 sets the applicability of ICH Q7 as beginning with the \"API starting material,\" these two terms are intended to refer to the same material."

    "Answer": "Initial review:\n\nInitial IRB approval should be performed at a convened IRB meeting. The IRB does not need to review and approve individual uses of an HUD, but rather the IRB may approve use of the device as it sees fit. That is, the IRB may approve use of the HUD without any further restrictions, under a protocol, or on a case-by-case basis.\n\nContinuing review:\n\nIRBs may approve the use of the device for a period of time, not to exceed one year. 21 CFR 56.109(f). In some higher risk cases, IRBs have approved HUDs for a specific number of patients and have required a summary report before approving the use in additional patients. Continuing review should follow the requirements found at 21 CFR 56, and may be conducted using the expedited review procedures (see 21 CFR 56.110) unless the IRB determines that full board review should be performed. The agency believes that the expedited review procedures are appropriate for continuing review since the initial review would have been performed by the full board and use of the HUD within its approved labeling does not constitute research."

    "Question": "Taking into account the content of Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , What is meant by \"APIs and intermediates can also be transferred under quarantine to another unit under the company's control...\" and is this applicable to contract manufacturers?",
    "Answer": "ICH Q7, paragraph 10.20 states \"APIs and intermediates should only be released for distribution to third parties after they have been released by the quality unit(s). APIs and intermediates can be transferred under quarantine to another unit under the company's control when authorized by the quality unit(s) and if appropriate controls and documentation are in place.\"\n\nThe second sentence in ICH Q7, paragraph 10.20 describes transport situations that are not considered distribution. It provides for physical movement (transfer but not release) of quarantined material to another unit. This unit can be on the same site, be on a different site (within the same company), or be a contract manufacturer (see final paragraph below).\n\nThe goal of transfer under quarantine is to allow transportation and testing in parallel. Material that is transferred under quarantine is not to be used for further processing until all testing and quality review is complete and the material is released by the quality unit as defined in ICH Q7, paragraph 2.22.\n\nThis provision for transfer under quarantine is included in ICH Q7 for situations where a company is shipping APIs or intermediates from one unit to another and has both (1) the need to expedite the shipping and (2) the material management system in place to prevent use of the material before full release. Examples of circumstances where transfer under quarantine may be necessary include extraordinary supply chain requirement(s) (e.g., short shelf-life), and materials with a lengthy time frame for required test(s) (e.g., some microbiological tests).\n\nWith appropriate oversight as described in ICH Q10, section III.G (2.7), including a written agreement as described in ICH Q7, paragraph 16.12, and appropriate ongoing controls, a contract manufacturer may be considered a \"unit under the company's control.\" There is a joint responsibility for both parties to clearly justify and document the need to transfer the unreleased intermediate or API and to ensure appropriate control is maintained to prevent use before full release."

Stand Alone Regional Result\n\nThe most persuasive would be demonstration of the effect in the entire study, with the results of each region of interest also demonstrating a statistically significant result. It will also be important to compare results across regions.\n\n2. No Significant Regional Result But Similar Results Across Regions\n\nWith an effect demonstrated in the entire study, an analysis of results by region might not show a significant result in a region of interest but the data might nonetheless be persuasive to regulators in that region. Consistent trends in endpoint(s) intended for comparison across the regions or, in the case of a dose-response study, similar dose-response relationships across regions, might support an argument that the drug is not sensitive to intrinsic or extrinsic ethnic factors. Other data, for example, from approved drugs in the same class within region(s) could support such a bridging conclusion."

  {
    "Question": "Delving into Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances , What is meant by impurities that \"persist\" in ICH Q11 Example 4? (5.8)",
    "Answer": "ICH Q11 recommends that \"manufacturing steps that impact the impurity profile of the drug substance should normally be included in the manufacturing process described in section 3.2.S.2.2 of the application.\" However, as described in ICH Q11 Example 4, this principle does not necessarily apply when impurities originate early and \"persist\" across multiple steps to the drug substance. It is normally expected that the justification for an impurity that persists will be based on it being carried across one or more manufacturing steps upstream of the proposed starting material, when these steps do not otherwise impact the impurity profile of the drug substance (for \"impact,\" see Q&A 5.7).\n\nIn Example 4, an impurity in Compound B impacts the impurity profile of the drug substance. Steps 2 and 3 (from Compound B to Compound D) do not introduce other impurities that impact the drug substance impurity profile. If impurities generated in Steps 2 or 3 do impact the drug substance impurity profile, these steps should also be considered for inclusion in 3.2.S.2.2 of the application.\n\nImpurities that persist may or may not react in subsequent steps, but are not removed to the extent that they would no longer be considered to impact the drug substance impurity profile. For example, an impurity that persists might have physico-chemical properties (e.g., solubility) similar to other intermediates or the drug substance, like the enantiomer in Example 4, which could make its removal intrinsically difficult.\n\nICH Q11 Example 4 illustrates that when the synthetic route contains an impurity that persists, it can be acceptable to control the impurity in the starting material specification even though it impacts the impurity profile of the drug substance. Therefore, it is not always necessary to include steps that form such an impurity in section 3.2.S.2.2, provided that the other ICH Q11 general principles are addressed (ICH Q11 section 5.1.1). Example 4 is not exclusive to stereoisomers and can be applied to other types of impurities that persist.\n\nIn Example 4, there are 3 chemical transformation steps between the starting material D and the drug substance. The 3 steps in Example 4 are not intended to imply that 3 chemical transformation steps are considered enough (see Q&A 5.11) in all cases, nor that 3 chemical transformation steps are mandatory.\n\nIn the case of Example 4, application of the ICH Q11 principles includes control of the enantiomer in the specification of the proposed starting material D, in combination with the understanding that the steps immediately prior to D do not introduce other impurities that impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. The applicant should provide information in the application on the upstream process to justify the proposed starting material including control strategy of the impurity that persists."

    "Question": "Based on the information from Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies , How critical to public health is adherence to FDA's recommendations with regard to projected thyroid radioactive exposure thresholds for intervention by risk category? Specifically, the existence of different thresholds for neonates, children through age 18, and pregnant or lactating women (\\(\\geq\\) 5 cGy) versus adults aged 18 through 40 years (\\(\\geq\\) 10 cGy) versus adults over age 40 (\\(\\geq\\) 500 cGy) are confusing and logistically complex to follow in responding to a radiological emergency.",
    "Answer": "The FDA recommendations for KI intervention encompass different threshold thyroid radioactive exposures for different groups within the population. Several factors were involved in this approach:\n* During the Chernobyl accident, younger people exposed to radioactive iodine (especially children 0 to 4 years old) were most sensitive to its carcinogenic effects.\nIn the years following the accident, most children who subsequently developed thyroid cancer apparently received internal thyroid radioactive exposures of less than 30 cGy, and the best dose-response information supports increased risk in children receiving 5 cGy or more.\n* As age increases, the risk of thyroidal side effects following excess (i.e., nonradioactive) iodine ingestion increases. This is due to the increasing prevalence of underlying thyroidal illness with older age (e.g., Graves' disease, thyroid nodules, Hashimoto's thyroiditis).\n* Thyroid irradiation in older adults (e.g., over 40 years of age) is associated with an extremely low incidence of cancer. Therefore, KI is only recommended if a very large internal radioactive dose to the thyroid is projected. In such a situation, KI would be ingested to prevent destruction of the thyroid gland, which, if it occurred, would lead to lifelong dependence on thyroid hormone replacement therapy.\n\nIn short, the recommended stepped intervention approach to KI use during radiation emergencies is based on differences in overall benefit versus risk in different population groups. Specifically, the benefits from thyroid blockade with KI predominate in the young in whom the risks of thyroid cancer from radioiodine are the greatest. The risks of KI take on more prominence in older adults in whom the risks of thyroid cancer are very small.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, it is important to note that among 7 million adults who took stable iodine in Poland following Chernobyl, only two severe adverse reactions were reported, both in persons with known allergy to iodine. Based on these data, we have concluded that even if the risks associated with excess stable iodine are greater in adults than in children, the risk of serious adverse reactions overall is exceedingly small.\n\nIn summary, FDA understands that a KI administration program that sets different projected thyroid radioactive exposure thresholds for treatment of different population groups may be logistically impractical to implement during a radiological emergency. If emergency planners reach this conclusion, FDA recommends that KI be administered to both children and adults at the lowest intervention threshold (i.e., \\(\\geq 5\\) cGy projected internal thyroid exposure in children).\n\nAs a rule, however, individuals with known allergy to KI or with pre-existing thyroid disease (e.g., Graves' disease, thyroid nodules, Hashimoto's thyroiditis) that might predispose them to adverse reactions should avoid KI. Most likely these will be adults, who have little or no risk of developing thyroid cancer from radioactive exposure to the thyroid and who may, in these cases, incur substantial risks from taking KI."

There are various risk assessment methodologies and tools that can be applied to clinical trials.10\\({}^{,}\\)11\n\nFootnote 10: See the ICH guidance for industry _Q9 Quality Risk Management_ (June 2006).\n\nThe risk assessment should inform the development of the clinical trial protocol and associated investigational plans, including the monitoring plan, and may also support efforts to manage risks during the conduct of a clinical investigation or across a product's development program. Therefore, sponsors should document their risk assessment, including methodologies used for the risk assessment, conclusions from the risk assessment, and how the assessment was used to make decisions on the management of the risks identified. Sponsors should reevaluate their risk assessment and management processes throughout the conduct of the investigation as issues are identified, and monitoring plans (and if necessary, protocol design) should be revised when needed to continue to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of participants in the clinical investigation and the integrity of data generated during the investigation. When new risks are identified, their potential impact across that product development program, as well as on the sponsor's other product development programs, as appropriate, should be considered. If a risk-based monitoring approach is being used, FDA may request, during inspection, documentation of the sponsor's initial risk assessment, and any relevant updated risk assessments.\n\nThe monitoring plan should include information regarding the identified risks and how the monitoring methods will address those risks. (See Q6 for further details.) The inclusion of these components in the monitoring plan will enhance the utility of the plan by providing a clear explanation of the identified risks and how they will be monitored, managed, and mitigated or eliminated."

    "Answer": "It is encouraged, but not mandatory, to include both men and women in the thorough QT study. Analyses of Concentration-Response Relationship by sex can be helpful for studying the effect of the drug on QT/QTc interval in cases where there is evidence or mechanistic theory for a gender difference. However, the primary analysis of a thorough QT study should be powered and conducted on the pooled population. If the primary analysis is negative and if there is no other evidence suggesting gender differences, subgroup analysis by sex is not expected."

    "Question": "Delving into M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals , The M3(R2) guidance provides advice on establishing the maximum dose (exposure) permitted in exploratory clinical trials but provides minimal guidance for establishing the maximum dose in standard phase 1 or clinical development trials. Can the maximum dose in standard phase 1 trials be based on the principles described for exploratory clinical trials (Table 3 of M3(R2))?",
    "Answer": "When the package of nonclinical studies meets the general recommendations of section V.A (5.1) of ICH M3(R2), then the maximum clinical dose for a clinical development phase 1 study can be based on standard risk assessments (e.g., whether the findings are reversible and/or monitorable, the severity of the indication, adverse effects in clinical studies; also see section VI (6) of ICH M3(R2) and regional guidances).

    "Question": "Given the context of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, How do Factors 1, 2, and 3 overlap in determining whether a product communication is consistent with the FDA-required labeling?",
    "Answer": "Given the potential for overlap in these three factors, FDA recognizes that there are questions about how a product communication that satisfies factor 1 could fail on factor 2 and/or 3. As a general matter, factor 1 primarily addresses situations where the information about the conditions of use described in the FDA-required labeling and in a firm's communication conflict with one another. However, while the FDA-required labeling provides essential information about the approved conditions of use, it is not intended to exhaustively address every possible scenario a firm could suggest in its communications - either to rule out or to endorse each possible scenario - and certain scenarios could negatively affect the safe and effective use of the product. As a result, simply analyzing whether there is a conflict between the information in the communication and the FDA-required labeling is not always sufficient to determine whether a communication is consistent with the FDA-required labeling. If a firm's communication suggests use of its product in a way that does not conflict with the FDA-required labeling but which nevertheless increases the potential for harm to health relative to the information reflected in the FDA-required labeling, the communication would not be consistent with the FDA-required labeling (factor 2). Similarly, if a firm's communication suggests use of a product in a way that does not conflict with the information in the FDA-required labeling but the FDA-required labeling would not provide adequate information to enable the product to be safely or effectively used under the conditions represented in the communication, the communication would not be consistent with the FDA-required labeling (factor 3)."

    "Question": "Delving into Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can an unapproved or uncleared investigational IVD device ever be used for nonemergency treatment of patients who do not meet the inclusion criteria of an investigational study?",
    "Answer": "Yes, in exceptional situations. FDA recognizes that there are circumstances when an unapproved or uncleared IVD is the only available option for a patient or small group of patients who do not meet the inclusion criteria and \"compassionate use\"/single patient use of the device may be appropriate. Section 561 of the Act. CBER refers to such situations as \"single patient exemptions.\" Appropriate patient protection measures are needed for these studies.\n\nUse of an investigational IVD device for one or a small group of patients who do not meet the study inclusion criteria would require a change to the investigational plan. 21 CFR 812.35(a). If the study is being conducted under an approved IDE, the sponsor should submit a supplement to the IDE requesting a change to the investigational plan for \"compassionate use.\" 21 CFR 812.35(a). The review of this supplement can be facilitated by a phone call to the reviewing division and by the submission by facsimile of an advanced copy of the supplement. If the investigational IVD device would require an FDA-approved IDE, but one has not yet been submitted or approved, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion where the sponsor submits a compassionate use request to CDRH or CBER, as appropriate, and follows the patient protection measures listed above for emergency use.4\n\nFootnote 4: See Chapter III, \u201cExpanded Access to Unapproved Devices,\u201d of the guidance document \u201dIDE Policies and Procedures,\u201d\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm0 80203.pdf.\n\nIf a study is being conducted according to an exemption under 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3), or as a non-significant risk IDE under 21 CFR 812.2(b), the sponsor should obtain prior approval for the specific compassionate use/single patient use for the individual(s) in question from the FDA and the reviewing IRB at the site where the physician proposes to use the device.

    "Answer": "It is appropriate to create new headings in the CSR and new appendices for these topics. The guidance provides for and focuses on efficacy and safety variables known at the time. Other topics should be well referenced in the CSR body and clearly identified in the table of contents.\n\nCurrent submission options include:\n\n1. Stand alone reports. These can be placed in \"parallel\" with the main clinical study report in the eCTD. For example, a clinical pharmacology study might have the clinical study report, a pharmacokinetic report, and an assay validation report. For an efficacy study with patient reported outcome (PRO) measures, there might be a PRO report. Each of these reports can be referenced under the same heading in the eCTD and placed alongside one another in the eCTD folder for that study. The nature of the information should be clearly described in the title of the document that is provided through the eCTD.\n2. Study tagging files. In a region where study tagging files are used, it is recommended that a file-tag option from the \"valid values list\" be used -- for example, safety report, antibacterial, special-pathogen (see Specifications for Study Tagging Files, http://www.ich.org/products/electronic-standards.html).\n\nAlternatively, if a file-tag that adequately describes the material you are planning to submit is not available, you can request that a new file-tag be made available. This request should be submitted to your regional authority. In the event that this change cannot be accommodated within your time frame, you can place the document with the main body of the report (i.e., the document would be tagged with the \"study-report-body\" file-tag).

    "Answer": "Based on comments that FDA received from a TPLP, TPLPs typically act as distributors for manufacturers. Therefore, unless the TPLP has ADR status with the manufacturer (which should be posted on the manufacturer's website and reflected in a written contract), the TPLP would be required to provide a pedigree prior to each wholesale distribution. Because of the unique ongoing relationship between a TPLP and a manufacturer, most, if not all, TPLPs distributing prescription drugs on behalf of a manufacturer would be able to obtain ADR status from the manufacturer with which they are doing business.

    "Answer": "The pharmacokinetics in geriatric patients (over the entire spectrum of the geriatric patient population) should be evaluated to identify age-related differences that are not explained by other factors such as reduced renal function or weight differences. The potential influence of impaired renal/hepatic function, as well as potential drug interactions, is often assessed in studies with nongeriatric subjects. Population pharmacokinetic analysis could provide the requested data if a sufficient number of patients in different age ranges (including patients \\(\\geq\\)65 and \\(\\geq\\)75 years) are included in the clinical trials. The applicability of population pharmacokinetics is dependent on several factors, e.g. the representation of the target population, the pharmacokinetics of the drug, dosing regimens, and analytical requirements. A specific pharmacokinetic study comparing nongeriatric and geriatric subjects in the same study (matched for relevant covariates, e.g., weight, sex) could achieve the same goals.

The extent and nature of the information in a monitoring report or equivalent documentation, and the types of contributors or stakeholders involved, will depend on factors such as the study complexity, expectations of regulatory agencies, and the type and extent of monitoring activities performed. At the discretion of the sponsor, monitoring reports may be specific to an individual site or may summarize monitoring activities across multiple sites. The level of detail in monitoring reports should align with the importance of the information and the intended audience.\n\nMonitoring reports or equivalent documentation for each site generally should be prepared, reviewed, and approved in a timely manner that reflects the importance and complexity of the information. Monitoring report content should be complete, accurate, concise, and clear, and should provide a manipulation-resistant record of the monitoring activities and results of the clinical investigation for regulatory purposes. Regulatory agencies may request records of monitoring activities, monitoring reports, or observations reported as the result of monitoring activities during their inspection or review of a clinical investigation. Therefore, sponsors should maintain a complete and accurate record of monitoring activities and results.\n\nMonitoring reports or equivalent documentation should evidence that monitoring activities were conducted in accordance with the monitoring plan and any other applicable procedures, and should document the oversight and monitoring performed during the clinical investigation, evaluate the impact of the monitoring on the adequacy of adherence to the research protocol, GCP requirements, and the rights, safety, and welfare of clinical investigation participants, and describe the action taken for identified issues. Monitoring reports should be concise, while providing a means to document and/or summarize issues that may affect the validity and integrity of the clinical data and information obtained during the clinical investigation.

In general, the records that are needed are those that provide the data for testing the study hypotheses. Records should contain sufficient detail to allow the study to be reproduced when the same protocol is followed. We recommend that investigators maintain detailed records because a review of the study may indicate the need for other analyses of the collected data.\n\nWe also recommend that investigators:\n\na.

    "Question": "Referring to Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Who is responsible for the accuracy of the Nutrition Facts label on a food product's label? Who is responsible for maintaining the records needed to verify the accuracy of certain nutrient declarations, including where a firm may perform operations that include those of an ingredient supplier, a manufacturer of a finished food sold under their own brand name, and/or a labeler that labels the product under the firm's or another firm's brand name?",
    "Answer": "The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits a person from introducing or delivering for introduction, or causing the delivery or introduction, into interstate commerce a misbranded food (21 U.S.C. 331(a)). For example, a supplier has responsibility to ensure that the information about the amount of a nutrient in an ingredient it sells to a manufacturer is accurate, where there is no suitable analytical method available that the manufacturer can use to measure the nutrient's quantity. The manufacturer has responsibility for the accuracy of the nutrient declarations on the label of its food and a manufacturer generally would receive information from its supplier about the amount of the nutrient in the ingredient to ensure the accuracy of the nutrient declaration on the finished food. A distributor that purchases a finished food and then labels the product under its own brand name has responsibility for the accuracy of its food label. Such a distributor also generally would receive information from its supplier (the manufacturer) about the amount of the nutrient in the finished food product to ensure the accuracy of the nutrient declaration on the finished food. Food manufacturers must make and keep records to support certain nutrient declarations on their product labels (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)). The recordkeeping requirements specified in 21 CFR 101.9(g), are only for foods for which Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) International or other reliable and appropriate analytical methods are not available (81 FR 33742 at 33775). The manufacturer of a finished food must make and keep records to support nutrient declarations, as required by 21 CFR 101.9(g)(10) and to make the recordsavailable during an inspection. The manufacturer would be expected to have information from its ingredient supplier if an ingredient contains a nutrient added by the supplier for which there is no suitable analytical method available that the manufacturer can use to measure the nutrient's quantity. In such a case, the amount of the nutrient added may be known only to the supplier. In situations where we inspect a distributor that distributes a product labeled under its own brand name, and that product includes a nutrient for which there is no suitable analytical method available to measure the nutrient's quantity, we intend to ask the distributor to provide information from the manufacturer that supports the nutrient declaration on the distributor's label for product the distributor introduced, or delivered for introduction, into interstate commerce. Without such information, it is not clear how a distributor could ensure its labeled nutrient declarations do not misbrand its product."

    "Question": "Guideline title: M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals  Clarification is sought on metabolites that may not be of toxicological concern. In ICH M3(R2), what is meant by \"most\" in the phrase \"most glutathione conjugates\"? Would acyl glucuronides that can undergo chemical rearrangement be an example of a concern? What should we do about chemically reactive metabolites?",
    "Answer": "Although there are relatively rare exceptions, most glutathione conjugates are formed by conjugation with reactive metabolites to form excretory metabolites that are not of toxicological concern. Most glucuronides are not of concern, except those that undergo chemical rearrangement (e.g., reactive acyl glucuronides). Highly chemically reactive metabolites, although of toxicological concern, do not generally accumulate in plasma due to their short half-life. Generally, it is not feasible to test highly reactive metabolites independently because of their instability, but they are assumed to contribute to the overall nonclinical toxicity of the drug."

    "Question": "Given the context of E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , In the ICH E14 guidance, the recommended metric to analyze for a crossover study is the largest time-matched mean difference between the drug and placebo (baseline-adjusted) over the collection period. Please discuss the most appropriate metric to assess a drug's effect on QT/QTc interval when the data are collected in a placebo-controlled parallel design study (i.e., when there is no corresponding placebo value for each patient). (4.1)",
    "Answer": "Regardless of the study design, \"the largest time-matched mean difference between drug and placebo (baseline-adjusted)\" is determined as follows: The mean QTc for the drug (i.e., averaged across the study population) is compared to the mean QTc for placebo (averaged across the study population) at each time point. The \"largest time-matched mean difference between drug and placebo\" is the largest of these differences at any time point.\n\nThe term \"baseline-adjusted\" in the ICH E14 guidance implies that the baseline data are taken into account in the statistical analysis.\n\nDifferences in baseline assessment between crossover and parallel design studies are discussed in Question Q11 (4.2)."

    "Question": "Guideline title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff What does FDA consider to be valid scientific evidence?",
    "Answer": "Valid scientific evidence is defined in the \"Medical Device Classification Procedures\" regulation, 21 CFR Part 860, as:\n\nEvidence from well-controlled investigations, partially controlled studies, studies and objective trials without matched controls, well-documented case histories conducted by qualified experts, and reports of significant human experience with a marketed device, from which it can fairly and responsibly be concluded by qualified experts that there is reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of a device under its conditions of use (21 CFR 860.7(c)(2)).\n\nThe intended use of the IVD, the level and quality of information in the literature relevant to the device use, and FDA knowledge of the technology obtained from reviewing other premarket applications determine the type of study and the level of evidence you may need to demonstrate reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness. For example, if you are studying an IVD device that uses a well-characterized technology and has an intended use that falls within a type of device that has been classified into Class I or Class II, the study may consist of a comparison of analytic performance to that of a legally marketed (i.e., predicate) device. On the other hand, if your IVD uses novel or unproven technology or has a new intended use, you may need to conduct a well-planned clinical study of the device in the target population defined by your intended use. You may contact the Division in the appropriate Center if you have questions regarding the type of study you need to conduct for your device.\n\nWe recommend that sponsors and investigators of all studies, including exempt studies under 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3), conduct the studies with the following goals in mind: producing valid scientific evidence of the product's safety and effectiveness and protecting the rights and welfare of study subjects. Sponsors and investigators of significant and non-significant risk studies must comply with the regulation requirements in 21 CFR Part 812. FDA recommends that sponsors and investigators of studies exempt from the majority of requirements under 21 CFR Part 812 use the relevant sections of 21 CFR Part 812 regarding the general conduct of device studies as guidance. (**General Regulatory Issues**, Section III of this guidance, discusses how 21 CFR Part 812 may apply to a particular IVD study.)"

    "Answer": "Yes. FDA interprets the definition of \"labeling\" in section 201(m) of the FD&C Act to include the product identifier. Accordingly, as part of registration and listing under 21 CFR part 207, a manufacturer of any prescription drug for commercial distribution39 must submit a copy of all current labeling as specified under SS 207.49(a)(15)(i), independent of approval status.\n\nFootnote 39: _Commercial distribution_ is defined in 21 CFR 207.1."

    "Question": "Having read through Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Does a non-affiliated member need to attend every IRB meeting?",
    "Answer": "No. Although 21 CFR 56.108(c) does not specifically require the presence of a member not otherwise affiliated with the institution to constitute a quorum, FDA considers the presence of such members an important element of the IRB's diversity. Therefore, frequent absence of all non-affiliated members is not acceptable to FDA. Acknowledging their important role, many IRBs have appointed more than one member who is not otherwise affiliated with the institution. FDA encourages IRBs to appoint members in accordance with 21 CFR 56.107(a) who will be able to participate fully in the IRB process."

    "Question": "Referring to Guidance for Industry- Food Allergen Labeling Exemption Petitions and Notifications , Are single ingredient foods required to comply with the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act?",
    "Answer": "Yes. Single ingredient foods must comply with the food allergen labeling requirements in section 403(w)(1) of the FD&C Act. A single ingredient food that is, or contains, protein derived from milk, egg, fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, or soybeans, may identify the food source in the Statement of Identity, i.e., name of the food (e.g., \"All-purpose wheat flour\"), or use the \"Contains\" statement format. Because a single-ingredient food does not require an ingredient list, FDA recommends that if a \"Contains\" statement format is used for a retail package, the statement be placed immediately above the manufacturer, packer, or distributor statement. For single ingredient foods intended for further manufacturing where the \"Contains\" statement format is used, we recommend that the Contains statement be placed on the front of the package of the food near the statement of identity.

    "Question": "Taking into account the content of Guidance for Industry | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk, If (Q)SAR predictions are made during drug development, should they be repeated for the marketing application? (9.1)",
    "Answer": "(Q)SAR models developed for use under ICH M7(R2) are generally updated regularly with new bacterial reverse mutagenicity assay data and more refined structural alerts. A Sponsor is not expected to update its (Q)SAR assessment during drug development unless there is a safety concern such as when newly available bacterial reverse mutagenicity assay data and/or mechanistic knowledge suggest that the prediction is incorrect. As an example, in cases where there is reason to question the outcome of a negative prediction (e.g., an aromatic amine is present, but the model gave a negative prediction), a reassessment is recommended. It is recommended that the sponsor rerun (Q)SAR predictions before the initial marketing application to ensure predictions reflect the most current data available. If the marketing application is later submitted in other regulatory jurisdictions, reassessment may be considered. Reassessment may also be considered if the predictions made for the initial global marketing application did not use a recent version of the software.\n\nIn general, predictions generated with models developed before ICH M7's publication in 2014 are considered unacceptable."

Unlike emergency use of an unapproved device discussed above, prior FDA approval is needed before compassionate use occurs. Section 561(b) of the act and 21 CFR 812.35. In order to obtain agency approval, the sponsor should submit an IDE supplement requesting approval for a protocol deviation under section 812.35(a) in order to treat the patient. The IDE supplement should include:\n\n* A description of the patient's condition and the circumstances necessitating treatment;\n* A discussion of why alternatives therapies are unsatisfactory and why the probable risk of using the investigational device is no greater than the probable risk from the disease or condition;\n* An identification of any deviations in the approved clinical protocol that may be needed in order to treat the patient; and\n* The patient protection measures listed above that will be followed.\n\n_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nThe patient identified in the supplement should not be treated with the device until FDA approves its use under the proposed circumstances. In reviewing this type of request, FDA will consider the above information as well as whether the preliminary evidence of safety and effectiveness justifies such use and whether such use would interfere with the conduct of a clinical trial to support marketing approval.\n\nIf the request is approved, the attending physician should devise an appropriate schedule for monitoring the patient, taking into consideration the investigational nature of the device and the specific needs of the patient. The patient should be monitored to detect any possible problems arising from the use of the device. Following the compassionate use of the device, a follow-up report should be submitted to FDA in which summary information regarding patient outcome is presented.

    "Question": "When considering the information from E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , The ICH E14 guidance emphasizes the importance of assay sensitivity and recommends the use of a positive control. In order to accept a negative thorough QT/QTc study, assay sensitivity should be established in the study by use of a positive control with a known QT-prolonging effect. Please clarify how to assess the adequacy of the positive control in the thorough QT study. (3.1)",
    "Answer": "The positive control in a study is used to test the study's ability (its _assay sensitivity_ ) to detect the study endpoint of interest, in this case QT prolongation by about 5 ms. If the study is able to detect such QT prolongation by the control, then a finding of no QT effect of that size for the test drug will constitute evidence that the test drug does not, in fact, prolong the QT interval by the amount of regulatory concern. There are two conditions required for ensuring such assay sensitivity:\n\n1. The positive control should show a significant increase in QTc, i.e., the lower bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) must be above 0 ms. This shows that the trial is capable of detecting an increase in QTc, a conclusion that is essential to concluding that a negative finding for the test drug is meaningful.\n2. The study should be able to detect an effect of about 5 ms (the QTc threshold of regulatory concern) if it is present. Therefore, the size of the effect of the positive control is of particular relevance. With this aim, there are at least two approaches: 1. To use a positive control showing an effect of greater than 5 ms (i.e., lower bound of a one-sided 95% CI \\(>\\) 5 ms). This approach has proven to be useful in many regulatory cases. However, if the positive control has too large an effect, the study's ability to detect a 5 ms QTc prolongation might be questioned. In this situation, the effect of the positive control could be examined at times other than the peak effect to determine whether an effect close to the threshold of regulatory concern can be detected. 2. To use a positive control with an effect close to 5 ms (point estimate of the maximum mean difference with placebo close to 5 ms, with a one-sided 95% CIlower bound \\(>0\\)). In using positive controls with smaller effects, it would be very important to have a reasonably precise estimate of the drug's usual effect.\n\nImportantly, whatever approach is used, the effect of the positive control (magnitude of peak and time course) should be reasonably similar to its usual effect. Data suggesting an underestimation of QTc might question the assay sensitivity, thus jeopardizing the interpretability of the thorough QT study results."

By consulting early with the Agency, the sponsor may learn whether specific studies are needed and whether to submit a claim of categorical exclusion or an EA with the NDA. Such knowledge can help the sponsor avoid late cycle information requests that could delay approval of the application and is especially important in the context of expedited drug development."

    "Answer": "In the preamble to the Establishment Registration and Listing final rule, with respect to the exception in 21 CFR 1271.15(b), we reported that we had received one comment on the proposed exception. We also reported that the comment assumed that hospitals retaining autologous tissue, not used in a scheduled surgical procedure, to be used in a subsequent application on the same patient, are exempt from registration and listing because the two applications are essentially a single continuous procedure.\n\nIn response to that comment, we stated the following:\n\n\"We agree that, so long as the hospital does not engage in any other activity encompassed with in [sic] the definition of \"manufacture,\" the hospital would not be required to register or comply with the other provisions to be codified in Part 1271. For example, if the hospital expanded the cells or tissues, it would not meet the terms of the exception. In reaching this conclusion, we note that hospitals that store autologous cells or tissues for subsequent application in the same patient must follow the guidelines of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO)4 for tissue storage, monitoring of storage devices, and tracking in order to obtain or maintain accreditation.\" (66 FR 5447 at 5460)"

    "Question": "When considering the information from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Are contract manufacturers considered \"manufacturers\" under the PDMA?",
    "Answer": "Yes. A contract manufacturer falls within the definition of a \"manufacturer\" under 21 CFR SS 203.3(s), which incorporates by reference the definition of \"manufacturer\" set forth in 21 CFR SS 201.1. FDA has received several inquiries regarding the status of an NDA-holder under 21 CFR SSS 203.3(s)/201.1 when that NDA-holder's prescription drugs are made by a contract manufacturer. Unless the NDA-holder has performed the operations necessary to achieve \"manufacturer\" status under 21 CFR SS 201.1, that NDAholder is not technically a \"manufacturer\" of the drugs within the meaning of the 21 CFR SS 203.3(s). In such instances, the NDA-holder would therefore not be exempt from the pedigree requirements on the grounds that it was a manufacturer. Thus, for purposes of the PDMA pedigree requirements only, FDA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion as follows: In those instances where a third party contract manufacturer manufacturers prescription drugs for an NDA-holder, that NDA-holder may also be regarded as a manufacturer of those drugs for purposes of that NDA-holder's compliance with SS 503(e)(1)(A) of the Act, entering into ADR agreements for those prescription drugs, and for purposes of pedigrees created for those prescription drugs. This exercise of enforcement discretion is not intended to relieve the contract manufacturer of its obligations as a manufacturer, including its obligation to register under SS 510 of the Act, nor is it intended to require the NDA-holder to file such a registration unless the NDA-holder would otherwise be obligated to do so."

    "Question": "As per the details in M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals , Why does Approach 4 have a more stringent maximum clinical dose than Approaches 3 and 5?",
    "Answer": "Approach 4 is the only one of these approaches that does not rely on the standard high-dose criteria described in section I.E (1.5) (MTD, MFD, 50X exposure multiple, or limit dose) in at least one species.\n\nIn Approach 4, the high dose in both the rodent and nonrodent studies is based on multiples of the proposed human exposure, and thus the high-dose selection recommendations described in section I.E (1.5) are not applied to either species. This is in contrast to Approach 3, in which the standard high-dose criteria should be met in both species, and in contrast to Approach 5, in which the standard high-dose criteria should be met in rodents. In Approach 3 and Approach 5, the use of standard high-dose selection criteria reduces the uncertainty around potential unidentified toxicities that might be relevant to humans.\n\nBecause Approach 4 uses exposure multiples for the high-dose selection in both species, it is possible that potential toxicity might not be identified in either species. In this case, more conservative limits on clinical exposure (e.g., 1/10th the exposure obtained using the lower exposure of the two species) are recommended because the dose-limiting toxicities of potential concern for clinical monitoring have not been identified. If toxicity is identified in one species, then the limit on clinical exposure is based on the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) exposure in the species with toxicity or \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) the NOAEL exposure in the species without toxicity, whichever is lower. This can yield a higher limit in Approach 4 than in the case where toxicity in neither species has been observed. The limit on clinical exposure for Approach 4 when based on toxicity can be comparable to the limit on clinical exposure in Approach 5. If dose-limiting toxicity is identified in both species using Approach 4, then the high-dose recommendations of section I.E (1.5) have been met or exceeded in both species and a maximum clinical dose can be based on standard risk assessment used for phase 1 trials and a clinical MTD can be explored."

    "Answer": "In this situation, if the clinical dose is escalated to 1/50\\({}^{\\text{th}}\\) of the maximum exposure in the animal studies and no treatment-related adverse effects are noted in volunteers/patients, for short-term clinical studies (e.g., 14 days duration) the clinical dose could be cautiously further escalated up to \\(1/10^{\\text{th}}\\) of the maximum exposure in the animal studies, or to a dose that produces adverse effects in humans, whichever occurs first.

    "Question": "In accordance with Treatment Use of Investigational Drugs Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Why does FDA review adverse event data for expanded access INDs?",
    "Answer": "From a public health perspective, early identification of important adverse events is beneficial. For example, a relatively rare adverse event might be detected during expanded access use, or such use might contribute safety information for a population not exposed to the drug in clinical trials. FDA is aware of a small number of cases in which clinical safety data from expanded access treatment was used to help assess the risks and benefits of the drug. In a very small number of cases, adverse event information from expanded access has contributed to safety information reflected in the FDA-approved labeling for a drug product. FDA is not aware of instances in which adverse event information from expanded access has prevented FDA from approving a drug. FDA reviewers of these adverse event data understand the context in which the expanded access use was permitted and will evaluate any adverse event data obtained from an expanded access submission within that context. For example, FDA reviewers recognize that:\n\n1. expanded access treatment generally occurs outside a controlled clinical trial setting;\n2. patients who receive a drug through expanded access may suffer from a more advanced stage of the disease or condition than patients participating in a clinical trial;\n3. patients who receive a drug through expanded access may be receiving other therapies for their disease or condition at the same time as the drug they are receiving through expanded access; and\n4. patients who receive a drug through expanded access may suffer from one or more comorbidities.\n\nAll of these factors make it difficult to link an expanded access treatment to a particular adverse event. Moreover, it is very rare for FDA to place an IND on clinical hold due to adverse events observed in expanded access treatment."

    "Question": "Delving into Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Since the court's order only applies to 21 CFR SS 203.50(a), does this mean that the statutory requirement that non-ADRs provide pedigrees that include \"each prior sale, purchase, or trade\" of the drugs is still in effect?",
    "Answer": " Yes. The court order does not enjoin FDA from enforcing the statute. The court order affects only the regulations at 21 CFR SS 203.50(a). It has been FDA's longstanding position, consistent with the language of the PDMA and its legislative history, that, 21 CFR SS 203.50 notwithstanding, the statute itself requires non-ADRs to provide pedigrees that documents each prior transaction going back to the manufacturer. FDA recognizes, however, that confusion regarding the pedigree requirement could cause disruptions or delays in the nation's drug distribution system. Accordingly, as long as the court order remains in effect, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion, as described below. To this end, FDA does not intend to enforce the statute insofar as it requires pedigrees to contain information regarding each transaction going back to the manufacturer. Rather, FDA intends to permit non-ADRs to provide pedigrees that include information regarding transactions going back to the manufacturer _or_ the last ADR that handled the prescription drugs.

Is there a recommended approach to QT correction that is different from that specified in ICH E14? (1.5)",
    "Answer": "Changes in heart rate could variably influence a drug's effect on repolarization (i.e., QT interval), and correction methods with different characteristics are often applied. The principles set below would be applicable in all clinical studies (thorough QT or other studies).\n\nIn adults, Bazett's correction has been clearly shown to be an inferior method of correcting for differences in heart rate among and within subjects. Therefore, QT interval data corrected using Bazett's corrections is no longer warranted in all applications unless there is a compelling reason for a comparison to historical Bazett's corrected QT data. Presentation of data with a Fridericia's correction is likely to be appropriate in most situations, but other methods could be more appropriate. There is no single recommended alternative (see Question Q4 (1.4) on Incorporating New Technologies), but the following are some considerations:\n\n1. Analyses of the same data using different models for correcting QT can generate discordant results. Therefore, it is important that the method(s) of correction, criteria for the selection of the method of correction, and rationale for the components of the method of correction be specified prior to analysis to limit bias. Model selection should be based on objective criteria and should consider the uncertainty in parameter estimates. Alternative methods of correction should be used only if the primary method fails the pre-specified criteria for selection of the method of correction.\n2. Corrections that are individualized to a subject's unique heart rate QT dynamic are not likely to work well when the data are sparse or when the baseline data upon which the correction is based do not cover at least the heart rate range observed in patients on the study drug."

    "Question": "Having read through Treatment Use of Investigational Drugs Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, When should an expanded access protocol submission be used?",
    "Answer": "An expanded access protocol submission for expanded access should be used only if the sponsor seeking expanded access has an existing IND in effect -- typically, such a sponsor is a commercial sponsor with an existing IND under which the sponsor is developing the drug for marketing. When there is an existing IND in effect, FDA generally encourages the submission of an expanded access protocol, rather than a new expanded access IND, because having all expanded access use and clinical trial use consolidated under a single IND may facilitate identification of safety concerns, may make the administrative process less burdensome for sponsors and FDA, and may help in product review."

    "Question": "As per the details in Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Would a series of invoices, transactions, or distributions constitute a written agreement?",
    "Answer": "No. An invoice simply documents drug distributions or transactions. A distribution or transaction is not a written agreement. 21 CFR SS 203.3(u) specifically requires a written agreement between a manufacturer and a wholesaler that documents the wholesaler's status as an authorized distributor. FDA recognizes that there may be situations where a wholesaler buys prescription drugs directly from the manufacturer, yet the manufacturer does not make the wholesaler an ADR. In this situation, although the wholesaler is not an ADR, the wholesaler is in a position to create and further provide a pedigree because the wholesaler would have all the information required by 21 CFR SS 203.50(a) since they purchased the prescription drugs directly from the manufacturer. In light of the December 1, 2006, implementation of 21 CFR SS203.3(u), FDA urges manufacturers to closely examine their business relationships with wholesalers, and if there is an ongoing relationship by virtue of direct, continued sales, enter into a written agreement to grant these wholesalers ADR status.

    "Answer": "The MAH should provide all information that is available at the time they prepare the PBRER. The MAH should specify what information is not available and fully explain why it is not available. For example, if it is not feasible to obtain precise cumulative clinical trial exposure data, the MAH should explain any omission of data from thecumulative data.

(3.3)",
    "Answer": "Optimally, the sponsor should demonstrate the independence of QTc to RR (RR is the time between heart beats, measured as R waves on the ECG) intervals observed in the study through QTc versus RR plots accompanied by additional information (e.g., number of matched QTc-RRpairs, correlation metric, 95% confidence intervals, p-values). QT-RR interval relationship is also important. Justification of correction factors used for QT measures should be provided when test drugs affect heart rate. In certain cases, individual QT correction based on QT-RR relationship is a preferred method because it is more accurate and sensitive than the general methods such as Bazett, Fridericia, or Van de Water when the test drugs affect heart rate. The main reason for not using correction formulae based on historical data is the fixed-rate correction coefficients. Non-rodent species show species-specific and individual differences in their QT-RR relationships."

    "Question": "As stated in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is it expected that equipment cleaning time limits be confirmed in cleaning validation?",
    "Answer": "Yes. Equipment cleaning is addressed in two sections in ICH Q7. Although the cleaning validation (ICH Q7, section XII.G (12.7)) does not specifically address time limits for cleaning, ICH Q7, paragraph 5.21, indicates that the maximum time between completion of processing and equipment cleaning (dirty hold time) should be established by the company. This maximum established dirty hold time is the time period for which evidence is available to demonstrate that the equipment can still be reliably cleaned. This maximum established dirty hold time is confirmed during the initial cleaning validation and can be extended with appropriate supporting data.\n\nAlthough ICH Q7 does not specify the need for time limits between equipment cleaning and use in the next process (clean hold time), ICH Q7, paragraph 5.21 does state that written procedures should include instructions for the protection of clean equipment from contamination prior to use and inspection of equipment for cleanliness immediately before use, if practicable."

    "Question": "Looking at the guidelines in E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs \n\nS7B Nonclinical Evaluation of the Potential for Delayed Ventricular Repolarization (QT Interval Prolongation) by Human Pharmaceuticals , When the thorough QT/QTc study is negative, routine ECG safety assessments in late phase clinical trials using fully automated reading methods will be adequate.",
    "Answer": "The ICH E14 guidance currently recommends either fully manual or manual adjudication approaches for clinical trials in which the assessment of ECG safety is an important objective, such as the thorough QT/QTc study. When the thorough QT study is positive, fully manual or manual adjudication methods are currently recommended for an adequate sample of patients in late phase studies (see section II.C (2.3) in the E14 guidance). When the thorough QT/QTc study is negative, routine ECG safety assessments in late phase clinical trials using fully automated reading methods will be adequate."

    "Question": "From what I've read in Direct Final Rule Procedures Guidance for FDA and Industry, What is the purpose of this guidance document?",
    "Answer": "This guidance is intended to help small businesses better understand and comply with the final rule establishing that certain active ingredients used in over-the-counter (OTC) consumer antiseptic wash products are not generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE), and thus, are ineligible for inclusion in the OTC topical antiseptic monograph. On September 6, 2016, FDA published a final rule that finalizes the nonmonograph status of 19 active ingredients, including triclosan and triclocarban, which are intended for use in OTC consumer antiseptic wash products (81 FR 61106) (Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule). Three active ingredients-- benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, and chloroxylenol -- were deferred from the final rule to allow more time for sponsors who proposed to complete the studies necessary to fill the safety and effectiveness data gaps identified for these ingredients. These deferrals are for one year, subject to renewal if adequate progress is made in filling the data gaps.\n\nThe final rule applies to consumer antiseptic wash products that are intended for use with water and are rinsed off after use, including consumer hand washes and consumer body washes. No additional safety or effectiveness data were submitted to support monograph conditions for the 19 consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients. Therefore, with the exception of the three deferred active ingredients, this rule finalizes the nonmonograph status of the remaining 19 active ingredients which are found to be not GRASE for use in consumer antiseptic wash products. Consumer antiseptic wash drug products containing one or more of these non-GRASE active ingredients will be considered new drugs for which approved new drug applications (NDAs) are required for marketing (21 USC 355(a)). The Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule is effective September 6, 2017.\n\nFDA has prepared this guidance in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121, as amended by Public Law 110-28)2 to assist small businesses in complying with the Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule.\n\nFootnote 2: 5 U.S.C. 601 (note)."

    "Question": "When considering the information from Medical Device Reporting for Manufacturers Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What information should firms include when disseminating HCEI?",
    "Answer": "To enable payors to make informed coverage and reimbursement decisions, firms should include appropriate background and contextual information when disseminating HCEI. Included below are examples of the types of background and contextual information that may be material to HCEI presentations; some of these categories of information may not be applicable to particular HCEI presentations. This information, where relevant, should be presented clearly and prominently. The disclosure of the pertinent information can be concise so long as all material information (such as the source(s) of data used, the outcome measures used, the type of analysis, the limitations of the analysis, and the generalizability of the findings) is provided, as further described below. FDA recommends that this contextual information be presented in conjunction with the information within the HCEI presentation to which it relates or that the HCEI presentation include a prominent reference to where the information can be found within the presentation.\n\nFDA is aware that some authoritative bodies have developed format recommendations for firms' communications to payors, which include recommendations for where firms should disclose the information described below within their communications. The recommendations provided here are not meant to suggest that firms should make duplicative disclosures of this background/contextual information if it is already provided in accordance with such format recommendations."

    "Question": "According to the M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals  The M3(R2) guidance says: \"Nonclinical characterization of a human metabolite(s) is only warranted when that metabolite(s) is observed at exposures greater than 10 percent of total drug-related exposure and at significantly greater levels in humans than the maximum exposure seen in the toxicity studies.\"_\n\n_When a human metabolite exposure is compared to the maximum exposure of that metabolite in toxicity studies, should it always be to the highest exposure achieved in the animal studies or is it more appropriate in some cases to use the exposure at the NOAEL, NOEL (no observed effect level), or MTD?",
    "Answer": "Because the parent drug and metabolites contribute to the target organ toxicity profile observed in animals at the MTD, the exposure comparisons across species should be conducted at the MTD in the animal compared to the maximum exposure in humans at the therapeutic dose, assuming the toxicity of concern can be adequately monitored in humans and does not pose an unacceptable risk. If the toxicity at the MTD is not monitorable in humans or poses an unacceptable risk, then the exposure comparison should be conducted at the NOAEL for the toxicity of concern."

    "Question": "As stated in Guidance for Industry- Interim Procedures for Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food and Human Dietary Supplements , Are there any other requirements for a dietary supplement to qualify for an antioxidant nutrient content claim?",
    "Answer": "Yes. The nutrients that are the subject of the claim must have recognized antioxidant activity. In addition, the level of each nutrient that is the subject of the claim must be sufficient to qualify for either \"high\" claims in 21 CFR 101.54(b), \"good source\" claims in 21 CFR 101.54(c), or \"more\" claims in 21 CFR 101.54(e). For example, for a product to qualify for a \"high in antioxidant vitamin C\" claim, it must contain 20 percent or more of the RDI for vitamin C. That is, it must meet the level for \"high\" defined in $101.54(b). For a product to qualify for a \"good source of antioxidant vitamin C\" claim it must contain 10 to 19 percent of the RDI for vitamin C.\n\n21 CFR 101.54(g)(2) and (g)(3)"

    "Question": "As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Which outsourced activities are covered by ICH Q7?",
    "Answer": "In the context of ICH Q7, contract manufacturing is the outsourced activity. The term _outsourced activities_, as defined and described in ICH Q10, section III.G (2.7) and Glossary (section VI (5)), aligns with the description of _contract manufacturer_ in ICH Q7, section XVI (16). ICH Q7 defines _manufacture_ as \"all operations of receipt of materials, production, packaging, repackaging, labeling, relabeling, quality control, release, storage, and distribution of APIs and related controls.\"\"Related controls\" include any activities or services necessary to support production (e.g., maintenance, calibration). ICH Q7 applies to any activities performed by the original manufacturer or the company that is performing the activity on behalf of the original manufacturer."

    "Question": "Taking into account the content of Treatment Use of Investigational Drugs Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, How does FDA determine that authorizing expanded access to a drug will not interfere with clinical trials or drug development?",
    "Answer": "Under 21 CFR 312.305(a)(3), to authorize any category of expanded access, FDA must determine that expanded access to the drug for the requested use will not interfere with the initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the expanded access use or otherwise compromise the potential development of the drug for the expanded access use. Generally, patients must be ineligible or otherwise unable (e.g., geographically unable to access a study site) to enter ongoing clinical trials to receive the drug under an expanded access IND or protocol. For all categories of expanded access, sponsors are required to include in their access submissions information adequate to demonstrate that expanded access to the drug will not interfere with clinical investigations or drug development, along with other information (SSSS 312.310(b), 312.315(c), and 312.320(b)).\n\nFDA believes that expanded access INDs or protocols that treat larger patient populations generally have the greatest potential to interfere with clinical investigations or drug development, because of their greater potential to interfere with recruiting patients for the clinical investigation(s). FDA typically determines whether an expanded access use will interfere with clinical investigations or drug development based on the information provided by the sponsor in its expanded access submission. If the information provided by the sponsor is not adequate for FDA to make this determination, FDA may ask the sponsor for additional information.\n\nFor example, before authorizing a treatment IND for a drug for which clinical trials are ongoing, FDA may ask the sponsor to explain how the sponsor will ensure that the treatment IND will not interfere with accrual of patients in the clinical trials, and how the sponsor will determine whether interference is occurring, if such information is not provided in the expanded access submission. More specifically, FDA may ask the sponsor to submit to its IND a comprehensive investigational plan with a timetable and milestones (if it has not done so already) so that FDA can periodically assess whether the treatment IND is affecting accrual of patients in the clinical trials or other parameters related to the pace of drug development. If FDA then determines that the ongoing treatment IND is interfering with clinical trials or drug development or that the sponsor is not pursuing, with due diligence, marketing approval for the expanded access use, FDA could place the treatment IND on clinical hold (SS 312.42(b)(3))."

    "Question": "As outlined in Assessing User Fees Under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022 , If a generic drug submission includes API information other than by reference to a DMF, is the applicant required to pay an additional fee?",
    "Answer": "Yes. The applicant is required to pay an API-related fee for each API manufactured in its own facility or facilities for which it has not previously paid an API-related fee. As with a DMF fee, this fee is paid only once.\n\nThe amount of the API-related fee is a function of the number of APIs referenced in the application and the number of facilities in which those APIs are manufactured. If the ANDA references more than one facility as manufacturing each API, the applicant must pay the API-related fee for each such facility. See the examples that follow.\n\nGDUFA specifies that the ANDA applicant must pay a fee for each API facility for which an API-related fee has not previously been paid that is described in the generic drug submission by means other than reference to a DMF.\n\nBecause the calculation is potentially confusing, we provide the following two examples.\n\n_Example One_:\n\nAn applicant (XYZ Corp.) submits an ANDA that describes manufacture of APIs, not by reference to DMFs.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \\hline\n**Product** & **API** & **Facility that has not paid API fee** \\\\ \\hline Drug X & Alpha & 1, 2, 3 \\\\ \\hline  & Beta & 1, 2 \\\\ \\hline  & Gamma & 1 \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\nIn this example, XYZ Corp. owes the following API-related fee:\n\n"

When the desiccant is used for bottles of solid oral dosage form products, should it be reported as a Supplement -- Changes Being Effected under section IX.C.2.b of the guidance?",
    "Answer": "Section IX.C.2 b. states that a change in or addition to or deletion of a desiccant should be reported in a _Supplement -- Changes Being Effected_. A change in desiccant refers to the type of desiccant used (e.g., silica gel, calcium chloride) oramount.

    "Answer": "In general, the MAH should perform the benefit-risk assessment within the context of the applicable reference product information for the PBRER. The E2C(R2) guidance does make provision for the MAH to use regional product information as the reference document. As such, the guidance does not exclude the possibility of a benefit-risk assessment within the context of a local label, which would most likely occur at the request of a specific regulatory authority for a specific product. The MAH could provide the assessment either within a suitable subsection of the PBRER or as an appendix."

    "Question": "When considering the information from Assessing User Fees Under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022 , When should the application filing fee for a serially submitted ANDA be paid?",
    "Answer": "In some circumstances, ANDA applicants choose to serially submit complete ANDAs in anticipation of a patent being listed for a reference listed drug (RLD) that is protected by new chemical entity (NCE) exclusivity and has no other patents listed. This is done because the ANDA cannot be submitted until the final year of the five-year exclusivity period, and then only if the submitter is challenging the patent. A single payment for multiple submissions of the same ANDA is required.\n\nApplicants who choose to serially submit complete ANDAs in anticipation of a patent being listed for a RLD that is protected by NCE exclusivity and has no other patents listed should refrain from remitting their application filing fee until such time as the applicant is instructed by OGD that it has a valid application. Once a patent has been listed and an application can therefore be received for review by OGD, an applicant will have 20 days in which to pay its user fee."

    "Question": "In accordance with Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Does the sugar created through enzymatic hydrolysis of lactose in low-lactose dairy products need to be declared as added sugars?",
    "Answer": "We received several comments to the Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels proposed rule related to lactose in dairy ingredients, which are summarized in Comment 209 of the Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels final rule (the final rule) (81 FR 33742 at 33835). The sugars in dairy ingredients, except lactose as defined in 21 CFR 168.122, are not included in the definition of added sugars. Moreover, lactose that meets our standard of identity is an added sugar.\n\nLactose, as a sugar in a dairy product, is a disaccharide that is captured on the Nutrition Facts label under the Total Sugars declaration. However, lactose that meets the definition in 21 CFR 168.122 is captured on the Nutrition Facts label under both the Added Sugars and Total Sugars declarations. We are aware that the enzyme lactase is used by industry to hydrolyze lactose present in dairy products for the purposes of reducing the lactose content in low-lactose dairy products. The hydrolysis of lactose results in the monosaccharides glucose and galactose. Regardless of whether hydrolysis of lactose, present in dairy products or in dairy ingredients by lactase is being utilized to reduce lactose or to increase the sweetness of the product, hydrolysis of lactose under such circumstances does not result in an increase in sugars that would affect the Total Sugars declaration. Moreover, to the extent lactose that meets our standard of identity in 21 CFR 168.122 is subject to hydrolysis, the Added Sugars declaration would be the same before and after the hydrolysis of such a lactose ingredient using lactase. Since the hydrolysis of lactose found in dairy products (e.g. milk) and dairy ingredients (e.g. stabilizers and texturizers), and the hydrolysis of lactose that meets our standard of identity, do not result in an increase in the Total Sugars declaration, the hydrolysis process also does not result in an increase in the caloric content of the food. Thus, the sugars created through enzymatic hydrolysis of lactose, whether present as a component of a dairy product, a dairy ingredient, or contributed by the addition of lactose that meets the definition in 21 CFR 168.122, do not change the declarations for Total Sugars or Added Sugars for the product."

    "Question": "As outlined in Treatment Use of Investigational Drugs Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is the difference between an expanded access protocol and a continuation or open-label safety protocol?",
    "Answer": "A continuation protocol describes a trial in which patients are allowed to remain on an investigational drug or cross over to an investigational drug from placebo or active control following conclusion of the randomized phase of a trial. An open-label safety study is an uncontrolled trial (i.e., there is no comparison or control group). The primary purpose of both continuation and open-label safety protocols, in contrast to expanded access protocols, is to obtain safety data on the investigational drug. The conduct of continuation and open-label safety protocols differs from that of expanded access protocols in that (1) participation in open-label safety and continuation protocols is usually limited to specific, named institutions/centers; (2) participating investigators in continuation or open-label safety protocols are already identified and trained to collect needed safety data; and (3) in the case of a continuation trial, participants are typically limited to those in the original randomized, controlled trial."

Added sugars include sugars (free, mono- and disaccharides), sugars from syrups and honey, and sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. Added sugars do not include fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers, e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate. In addition, added sugars do not include fruit or vegetable juice concentrates used towards the total juice percentage label declaration under SS 101.30 or for Brix standardization under SS 102.33(g)(2) of this chapter (refers to SS 101). We also do not include fruit juice concentrates which are used to formulate the fruit component of jellies, jams, or preserves in accordance with the standard of identities set forth in SSS 150.140 and 150.160 of this chapter, or the fruit component of fruit spreads as added sugars."

    "Answer": "Reserve samples establish the identity of the products tested in the actual study, allow for confirmation of the validity and reliability of the results of the study, and facilitate investigation of further follow-up questions that arise after the studies are completed. FDA recommends that the sponsor of a proposed biosimilar product retain reserve samples for at least 5 years following the date on which the 351(k) application is licensed, or, if such application is not licensed, at least 5 years following the date of completion of a comparative clinical PK and/or PD study of the reference product and the proposed biosimilar product (or other clinical study in which PK or PD samples are collected with the primary objective of assessing PK or PD similarity) that is intended to support a submission under section 351(k) of the PHS Act. Contact FDA for specific advice if an alternative approach is being considered. For a three-way PK similarity study, FDA recommends that samples of both comparator products be retained, in addition to samples of the proposed biosimilar product.\n\nFor most protein therapeutics, FDA recommends that a sponsor retain the following quantities of product and dosage units, which are expected to be sufficient for evaluation by state of the art analytical methods:\n\n* Minimum of 10 dosage units each of the proposed biosimilar product, reference product and, if applicable, non-U.S.-licensed comparator product, depending on the amount of product within each unit; in general, this should provide for a total product mass of equal to or greater than 200 mg in a volume equal to or greater than 10 mL\n\nFDA recommends that the sponsor contact the review division to discuss the appropriate quantities of reserve samples in the following situations:\n\n* A product mass of equal to or greater than 200 mg in a volume equal to or greater than 10 mL requires a large number of dosage units\n* Biological products other than protein therapeutics"

    "Question": "Guideline title: E3 Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports Some in the pharmaceutical industry have expressed concern that the ICH E3 guidance, Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports (ICH E3), is intended as a requirement (i.e., a template that must be followed). The fact that the ICH M4 guidance for the Common Technical Document (CTD) refers to specific structural elements described in ICH E3 (e.g., Clinical Study Report (CSR) section headings) may have contributed to this interpretation. Interpretation of ICH E3 as a rigid templatecan result in presentation of redundant and suboptimal information in CSRs. This is a particular problem when ICH E3 is used for studies for which it was not designed (e.g., pharmacokinetic studies or studies with health economic or quality of life outcomes). Can ICH reaffirm that ICH E3 is a guidance and not a required template and that ICH E3 can be adapted to report studies that fall outside the original scope of ICH E3?",
    "Answer": "Yes. ICH E3 is a guidance, not a set of rigid requirements or a template, and flexibility is inherent in its use. \"The [guidance] is intended to assist sponsors in the development of a report that is complete, free from ambiguity, well organized, and easy to review.\" Modifications and adaptations to the structure presented in the guidance that lead to better display and communication of information are encouraged.\n\nThe introduction to ICH E3 (page 3) clearly indicates that ICH E3 is to be interpreted as a guidance, not a set of requirements: \"Each report should consider all of the topics described (unless clearly not relevant) although the specific sequence and grouping of topics may be changed if alternatives are more logical for a particular study. Some data in the appendices are specific requirements of individual regulatory authorities and should be submitted as appropriate. The numbering should then be adapted accordingly.\"\n\nTo illustrate this flexibility, consider demographic baseline information. ICH E3 suggests presentation of this information in the efficacy evaluation, but many variations of this presentation are possible. For example, if the efficacy and safety populations differ substantially, it would be appropriate to present demographic and baseline characteristics for the safety and efficacy populations in the safety and efficacy sections or in a new section preceding the efficacy and safety results sections.\n\nIf particular types of information or topics are not addressed in ICH E3 or if their location is not specified, this information or topic should be placed in the section that is most relevant. For example, pharmacokinetic or quality of life results could be placed in appropriately identified subsections of the efficacy and safety results sections, or they could be placed in new, appropriately identified results sections.\n\nIf a report does not address all the aspects of ICH E3 that are relevant for a given study, this should be clearly indicated and the rationale for doing so should be provided -- for example, if there is no presentation of efficacy for an efficacy study. A rationale is not necessary if sections presented in ICH E3 are reordered, renamed, or deleted (if warranted by the study design) or if new sections are added.\n\nIt should be noted that ICH E3 was developed for submission of adequate and well-controlled clinical effectiveness studies. Nevertheless, the basic principles described can be applied to other kinds of trials, such as clinical pharmacology studies and open-label safety studies, recognizing that not all sections or data presentations may be appropriate or important for these other types of trials. Sponsors are encouraged to adapt the recommendations in the guidance as appropriate (e.g., by deleting sections that are not relevant or adding important sections that are not mentioned in the guidance)."

    "Answer": "Manufacturing and labeling of raw materials for use by API manufacturers is outside the scope of ICH Q7. For this reason, retest and expiry dates, as defined in ICH Q7, do not strictly apply to raw materials and may be used in a different manner by the raw material supplier. _Expiry date_, as defined in the Glossary (section 20) of ICH Q7, applies specifically to the API.\n\nAPI manufacturers may re-evaluate (ICH Q7, section VII.E (7.5)) and then use a raw material after the expiry date or retest date, based on an appropriate scientific and risk-based justification (e.g., understanding of material attributes, testing, and stability). Similar justifications may be used to extend the date by which the material should be re-evaluated. It is the responsibility of the API manufacturer to ensure the raw materials are appropriate for the intended use at the time of use."

    "Answer": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA has continued, on a case-by-case basis, to conduct mission-critical inspections and other activities to ensure that FDA-regulated pharmaceutical products are meeting applicable FDA requirements.\n\nIn the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA announced that it was temporarily postponing all domestic and foreign routine surveillance facility inspections. Similarly, routine surveillance inspections in support of the Bioresearch Monitoring (BIMO) program were postponed.\n\nBeginning the week of July 20, 2020, FDA resumed prioritized domestic inspections, as described in the FDA statement \"Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA prepares for resumption of domestic inspections with new risk assessment system\" issued on July 10, 2020.4 As explained in this statement, FDA uses its COVID-19 Advisory Rating system to determine what categories of regulatory activity can take place in a given geographic region. Based on this determination, FDA is either continuing, on a case-by-case basis, to conduct only \"mission-critical\" inspections,5 or, where possible to do so safely, resuming prioritized domestic inspections, which generally include preapproval, pre-license, surveillance, and for-cause inspections.

    "Question": "Guideline title: E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs  The ICH E14 guidance emphasizes the importance of assay sensitivity and recommends the use of a positive control. In order to accept a negative thorough QT/QTc study, assay sensitivity should be established in the study by use of a positive control with a known QT-prolonging effect. Please clarify how to assess the adequacy of the positive control in the thorough QT study. (3.1)",
    "Answer": "The positive control in a study is used to test the study's ability (its _assay sensitivity_ ) to detect the study endpoint of interest, in this case QT prolongation by about 5 ms. If the study is able to detect such QT prolongation by the control, then a finding of no QT effect of that size for the test drug will constitute evidence that the test drug does not, in fact, prolong the QT interval by the amount of regulatory concern. There are two conditions required for ensuring such assay sensitivity:\n\n1. The positive control should show a significant increase in QTc, i.e., the lower bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) must be above 0 ms. This shows that the trial is capable of detecting an increase in QTc, a conclusion that is essential to concluding that a negative finding for the test drug is meaningful.\n2. The study should be able to detect an effect of about 5 ms (the QTc threshold of regulatory concern) if it is present. Therefore, the size of the effect of the positive control is of particular relevance. With this aim, there are at least two approaches: 1. To use a positive control showing an effect of greater than 5 ms (i.e., lower bound of a one-sided 95% CI \\(>\\) 5 ms). This approach has proven to be useful in many regulatory cases. However, if the positive control has too large an effect, the study's ability to detect a 5 ms QTc prolongation might be questioned. In this situation, the effect of the positive control could be examined at times other than the peak effect to determine whether an effect close to the threshold of regulatory concern can be detected. 2. To use a positive control with an effect close to 5 ms (point estimate of the maximum mean difference with placebo close to 5 ms, with a one-sided 95% CIlower bound \\(>0\\)). In using positive controls with smaller effects, it would be very important to have a reasonably precise estimate of the drug's usual effect.\n\nImportantly, whatever approach is used, the effect of the positive control (magnitude of peak and time course) should be reasonably similar to its usual effect. Data suggesting an underestimation of QTc might question the assay sensitivity, thus jeopardizing the interpretability of the thorough QT study results."

    "Question": "Taking into account the content of E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , Please discuss the need for baseline measurements, and when needed, how they should be collected, for cross-over and parallel design thorough QT studies. (4.2)",
    "Answer": "Adjustment for baseline measurements is potentially useful for several purposes, including detection of carry-over effects, reducing the influence of inter-subject differences, and accounting for diurnal effects such as those due to food. There is no single best approach for baseline adjustment, but all planned baseline computations should be prospectively defined in the clinical trial protocol. Two kinds of baseline are commonly used: _time-matched_ baseline (taken at exactly the same time-points on the day prior to the beginning of treatment as on the treatment day) and _predose_ baseline (taken shortly prior to dosing). The _predose_ baseline is used for adjustment for inter-subject differences but not for diurnal effects. The choice of baseline is influenced by whether the study is parallel or crossover."

    "Question": "In light of the details from Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, What is the recommended reporting category for a drug product (immediate release solid oral dosage form) scale change beyond 10 times the size of the biobatch? If the change is annual reportable, should the information identified in SUPAC-IR3 for a Level 1 scale change be submitted?",
    "Answer": "All changes in the scale of the nonprotein drug product manufacturing batches can be reported in an annual report (see section VII.D.1.a).4 However, if the scale change results in other changes (e.g., equipment, process), the change would be considered a multiple change, and the recommended reporting category should be the most restrictive of those for any of the individual changes (section XII). Recommendations on scale changes for protein drug products are included in section VII.C.1.c and VII.D.1.a of the guidance. Footnote 4: The reporting categories in the _Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA_ guidance supersede those recommended in SUPAC guidances where there are inconsistencies. Therefore, the recommendations in SUPAC-IR that certain scale changes be submitted in supplements are superseded.\n\nThe information and data recommendations in SUPAC-IR can be used to support a change. However, the data and information that should be included in the annual report to support the change depends on the extent of the scale change. If the scale change is up to and including 10 times the size of the biobatch, the data and information recommended in SUPAC-IR section V.A (Level 1) should be submitted. If the scale up is greater than 10 times the size of the biobatch, the data and information recommended in SUPAC-IR Section V.B (Level 2) should be submitted."

    "Question": "Based on the information from FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, Can a physician use an unapproved device in an emergency?",
    "Answer": "In general, an unapproved medical device may be used only on human subjects when the device is under clinical investigation and when used by investigators participating in a clinical trial. Section 561 of the Act, however, recognizes that there may be circumstances under which a health care provider may wish to use an unapproved device to save the life of a patient or to prevent irreversible morbidity when there exists no other alternative therapy. For investigational devices under an IDE, the IDE regulation permits deviations from the investigational plan without prior approval when necessary to protect the life or physical well-being of a subject in an emergency. (See 21 CFR 812.35(a)). A physician may treat a patient with an unapproved medical device in an emergency situation if he/she concludes that:\n\n* The patient has a life-threatening condition that needs immediate treatment;7 Footnote 7: FDA considers \u201clife-threatening condition\u201d to include serious diseases or conditions such as sight-threatening and limb-threatening conditions as well as other situations involving risk of irreversible morbidity.\n* No generally acceptable alternative treatment for the condition exists; and\n* Because of the immediate need to use the device, there is no time to use existing procedures to get FDA approval for the use.\n\nFDA expects the physician to make the determination that the patient's circumstances meet the above criteria, to assess the potential for benefit from the use of the unapproved device, and to have substantial reason to believe that benefits will exist. In the event that a device is used in circumstances meeting the criteria listed above, the physician should follow as many of the patient protection procedures listed below as possible:\n\n* Informed consent from the patient or a legal representative;\n* Clearance from the institution as specified by their policies;_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\n* Concurrence of the IRB chairperson;\n* An assessment from a physician who is not participating in the study; and\n* Authorization from the IDE sponsor, if an IDE exists for the device.\n\nWhile prior approval for shipment or emergency use of the investigational device is not required, the use must be reported to FDA by the IDE sponsor within 5 working days from the time the sponsor learns of the use. 21 CFR 812.35(a)(2) and 812.150(a)(4). The report should contain a summary of the conditions constituting the emergency, patient outcome information, and the patient protection measures that were followed. If no IDE exists, the physician should follow the above procedures and report the emergency use to CDRH or CBER."

    "Question": "Based on the information from None, Does registration imply that an IRB is in full compliance with 21 CFR Part 56 or is otherwise meeting a particular standard of competence or expertise?",
    "Answer": "No. IRB registration is not a form of accreditation or certification by FDA that the IRB is in full compliance with 21 CFR Part 56. While a U.S. IRB that reviews FDA-regulated studies must register to be in compliance with 21 CFR Part 56.106(a), IRB registration does not address issues regarding an IRB's competence or expertise nor does it require IRBs to meet a particular standard in order to conduct a review."

Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc), wholesale distribution is defined as the distribution of prescription drugs to persons other than a consumer or patient. Although a physician's office is not explicitly mentioned in 21 CFR SS 203.50, which discusses pedigree, it is contemplated within the scope of the language set forth in SS 503(e)(1)(A) of the Act that a pedigree would be provided because physicians offices are not specifically excluded."

    "Question": "Having read through Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What level or size of a package is required to have a product identifier?",
    "Answer": "Under section 582(b)(2) and (e)(2) of the FD&C Act, manufacturers and repackagers are required to affix or imprint product identifiers to packages and homogenous cases of product. Based on the definition of package,35 this means that the product identifier must be affixed or imprinted on the smallest individual saleable unit of product for distribution by a manufacturer or repackager that is intended by the manufacturer for ultimate sale to a dispenser36 of such product.\n\nFootnote 35: _Package_ is defined in section 581(11) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 36: _Dispenser_ is defined in section 581(3) of the FD&C Act.\n\nTherefore, manufacturers and repackagers must determine the smallest individual saleable unit product configuration that they intend to be sold to the dispenser, and affix or imprint a product identifier (included in a 2-dimensional data matrix barcode) to that package.\n\nTo determine what constitutes a package, manufacturers and repackagers should consider how their packages of product may be opened and separated by wholesale distributors, who may sell smaller individual units of product that were inside the larger package to a dispenser for ultimate dispensing or administration to a patient. For example, although a carton of 10 individual product units may be sold to a dispenser, manufacturers and repackagers may want to apply a product identifier to each of the 10 product units in the carton if it is reasonably foreseeable that a wholesale distributor might sell individual product units to a dispenser. See Section IX.E of this guidance for examples of potential individual saleable units and a discussion of the applicable barcode requirements. Also, see Section IX.C for additional regulatory requirements that may apply when determining whether to affix or imprint a product identifier to a product unit."

    "Answer": "For APIs with a retest date, ICH Q7, paragraph 6.13 states that records related to production, control, and distribution should be retained for at least 3 years after the API batch is \"completely distributed,\" which is understood as the complete distribution of the entire batch of the API by the API manufacturer to the next party in the supply chain. In the case of APIs handled by agents, brokers, traders, distributors, repackers, and relabelers (ICH Q7, section XVII (17)), \"completely distributed\" refers to distribution of the received quantity of the batch of API.\n\nThe intent of ICH Q7 is that records be retained for the period of time that the API could be on the market in order to investigate any problems and/or product complaints. Based on accepted industry practice at the time ICH Q7 was written, it was not anticipated that a manufacturer would set a retest date longer than 3 years. However, the use of \"at least 3 years\" in this section of ICH Q7 covers longer record retention periods, which is in alignment with the basic GMP principle and/or regional requirements that records be retained for the entire period the material is available on the market.\n\nIt is good industry practice to consider retaining records for the period of time the drug product(s) in which the API was used may be available on the market."

    "Question": "When considering the information from Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances , ICH Q11 states that \"enough of the drug substance manufacturing process should be described in the application...\" What considerations should an applicant apply in the selection of the proposed starting materials to assure that enough of the drug substance manufacturing process will be described in the process description in section 3.2.S.2.2 of the application? (5.11)",
    "Answer": "In deciding whether enough of the drug substance manufacturing process is described in section 3.2.S.2.2 of the application, the following considerations should be applied.\n\nThe applicant should first evaluate which chemical transformation steps in the manufacturing process impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. These steps should normally be included in section 3.2.S.2.2 (see Q&As 5.7, 5.8 and 5.9).\n\nNext, the applicant should examine the steps immediately upstream of those steps that impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. These steps should normally also be included in section 3.2.S.2.2 if:\n\n* They need to be carefully controlled (e.g., within narrow parameter ranges) to prevent generation of impurities that would otherwise impact the impurity profile of the drug substance.\n* They include a unit operation that has been added to the manufacturing process to control specific impurities that would otherwise impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. While starting material manufacturing processes typically contain purification operations, addition of purification steps prior to a proposed starting material in order to avoid defining an earlier, upstream compound as the starting material would not be considered appropriate.\n\nAfter these considerations, if the evaluation would result in only a small number of chemical transformation steps, then it is generally appropriate to include one or more additional chemical transformation steps in section 3.2.S.2.2. This is to ensure that enough steps are conducted under GMP to appropriately mitigate risks associated with contamination and future changes to the synthetic route or supplier of the starting material. The following paragraphs provide further clarification on this risk mitigation and should be considered together.\n\n* Although ICH Q11 does not specify how many steps should be performed under GMP, ICH Q11 recommends the inclusion of \"multiple chemical transformation steps\" in section 3.2.S.2.2 in order to reduce the risk of contamination and support the effective implementation of the control strategy throughout the product lifecycle. When there would be a small number of steps, there is an increased risk of contamination that needs to be addressed by the applicant in their starting material justification, and will often be best mitigated by including one or more additional steps in section 3.2.S.2.\n* Potential risks from future changes to the starting material synthesis should also be considered (see Q&A 5.16). There is an increased risk that impurities generated as a result of a change to the manufacturing process upstream of the starting material may not be detected or purged appropriately if the starting material is only a small number of steps from the drug substance. In order to determine how many additional steps to include, the applicant may also consider other approaches to risk mitigation; for example, inclusion of analytical methodologies in the specification of the proposed starting material that are designed to detect a wide range of possible impurities based on different physical and chemical separation and detection principles. Appropriate acceptance criteria for unspecified impurities should be included in the specification.\n\nThe applicant should include in their justification of the proposed starting material a comprehensive description as to what factors were considered in deciding whether enough of the drug substance manufacturing process is provided in section 3.2.S.2.2 of the application to ensure that risks are appropriately mitigated."

    "Answer": "The GLPs do not specify the amount of detail to be included in the SOPs. The SOPs are intended to minimize the introduction of systematic error into a study by ensuring that all personnel will be familiar with and use the same procedures. The adequacy of the SOPs is a key responsibility of management. A guideline of adequacy that could be used is to determine whether the SOPs are understood and can be followed by trained laboratory personnel."

    "Question": "Guideline title: Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry  Is a pedigree required for medical kits that contain prescription drugs, sometimes referred to as convenience kits?",
    "Answer": "Yes. \"Medical kits\" that contain devices and prescription drugs are combination products under 21 CFR SS3.2(e)(2), which are defined as \"two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of a drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products.\" The \"medical kits\" referred to in the question consist of separable finished devices and drugs that are combined in a kit for ready availability and use together in a medical setting. The drug product in the kit retains its separate form and individual packaging. Although these kits may be assigned to FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) as the lead Center for regulatory review when the primary mode of action of the kit is attributable to its device component, regulations for the drug and the device components continue to apply. Because a prescription drug component of a convenience kit is separable, and in the same form as when distributed independently, it is subject to the same pedigree requirements as when it is independently distributed. The pedigree must contain the drug's lot or control number(s), pursuant to 21 CFR SS203.50(a). We recognize that the convenience kit itself may have a lot or control number that is different than that on the prescription drug component. The outer container of the kit should also list the lot or control number of the prescription drug component so that the integrity of the kit's seal would not have to be compromised to confirm that the drug's lot number is the same as that listed in the pedigree. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document."

(4.2)",
    "Answer": "Sponsors can use results from a qualified proarrhythmia model as one component in the totality of evidence approach to risk assessment under the context of use for which the model was developed and qualified. When a facility intends to use the model to produce data for regulatory submission, a set of control compound(s) should be tested to assess the consistency between the new data and the historical laboratory-specific validation data. The number and type of laboratory-specific calibration and control compounds should be justified."

    "Answer": "Yes, if potential participants are non-English speaking or the clinical investigator or IRB anticipates that the consent interviews will be conducted in a language other than English, the IRB should require investigators or sponsors to prepare translated consent documents. FDA recommends that the IRB review, and if appropriate, approve procedures for ensuring that the translations will be prepared by a qualified individual or entity. However, FDA will not provide translations of the statement. We have written the required statement to use simpler language and do not believe that the statement will pose translation difficulties."

    "Question": "Delving into Guidance for Industry | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk, What is meant by \"for impurities introduced in the last synthetic step, an Option 1 control approach would be expected unless otherwise justified\" in section VIII.B (8.2), Considerations for Control Approaches? (8.3)",
    "Answer": "For mutagenic impurities introduced or generated in the last synthetic step, given the proximity to the final product, Option 1 control approach is preferred. However, Option 2 and Option 3 control approaches may be possible when appropriately justified. The control strategy may be influenced by the presence of a subsequent recrystallization step, a highly effective purification operation (e.g., chromatography, well-defined crystallization), the reactivity (e.g., highly reactive reagents such as thionyl chloride) and physical characteristics of the impurity (e.g., low boiling point such as methyl chloride), and the availability of data (analytical data supporting the purge assessment). In most cases, for mutagenic impurities introduced or generated in the last synthetic step, the justification of an Option 4 control approach solely based on prediction is not sufficient and supporting analytical data should be provided (see Question Q19 (8.1))."

    "Question": "As stated in M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals , In case of combinations with at least one biotechnology-derived product, does section XVII Combination Drug Toxicity Testing (17) apply as such, or only with regard to timing as suggested in section I.C (1.3) on the scope of the M3(R2) guidance? And in case of the latter, which guidance would (still) apply in deciding whether and which types of studies would be recommended?",
    "Answer": "For biotechnology-derived products, appropriate nonclinical safety studies should be determined in accordance with ICH S6(R1). However, the topic of combination toxicity studies is not addressed by that guidance. When the combination consists of a biotechnology-derived component and a non-biotechnology-derived component, the design and feasibility of any nonclinical combination study are complex and should be considered on a case-by-case basis. The rationale for such a study should be clearly scientifically justified, using the principles of ICH S6(R1) and ICH M3(R2)."

    "Question": "Based on the information from Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Some ingredients contain mono- and disaccharides (DP1 and DP2 (one and two degrees of polymerization)) that are created through processes such as hydrolysis. Do the mono- and disaccharide portions of ingredients that are created through hydrolysis need to be declared as added sugars on the label?",
    "Answer": "In the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33832), we said that, other than sugar syrup types of products where the sugars are specifically and purposely produced via hydrolysis, we do not have information suggesting that sugars produced through incidental hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates results in significant increase in the sugar content of foods. We did not receive any comments or other information suggesting that these sugars should be captured under the added sugars declaration, and we did not include sugars produced through incidental hydrolysis in our definition of added sugars (id.). Therefore, such sugars would not be declared as added sugars on the label. We also explained that if a manufacturer purposely employs a hydrolysis step as part of a food manufacturing process to increase the sugar content of a food product (e.g. enzymatic hydrolysis of corn starch to make corn syrup in the same facility as part of the cookie-making process), we would consider the sugar generated from the hydrolysis step to be added sugars, since hydrolysis was purposely used by the manufacturer to increase the sugar content of the product (id.).\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33835), we also said that, in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Report (2015 DGAC Report).\n\nManufacturers may purposely employ methods, such as hydrolysis, for a number of reasons, some of which result in an ingredient containing mono- and disaccharides with DP1 and DP2. Ingredients such as maltodextrin and corn syrup solids are hydrolyzed to achieve various degrees of dextrose equivalence (DE). The higher the DE, the lower the degree of polymerization, and the sweeter the ingredient becomes. Maltodext (21 CFR 184.1444) are ingredients with a DE less than 20, and corn syrup (21 CFR 168.120, 168.121, and 184.1865) are ingredients with a DE of 20 or higher. Depending on the manufacturing process, different maltodextrin and corn syrup will have different DE and different amounts of mono- and disaccharides. Although maltodext are not used primarily for sweetening purposes, depending on the DE, some can contain 8-9% mono and disaccharides and can contribute to sweetness. We also understand that the hydrolysis process to manufacture maltodextrin and corn syrup are controlled so that the desired DE can be consistently achieved. This indicates that some maltodext and corn syrup solids are manufactured purposely to contain certain levels of mono- and disaccharides. Information that is publicly available (e.g., online product specification sheets and reference materials) indicates that manufacturers have knowledge of the level of mono- and disaccharides created during the processing of ingredients through controlled hydrolysis.\n\nMaltodext, corn syrups, and other ingredients with mono-and disaccharides that are created through controlled hydrolysis are widely used by manufacturers and are present in many different types of food products (47 FR 36443 at 36444, September 20, 1982). The sugars contributed by these ingredients are consistent with the concept of empty calories as described in the 2015 DGAC Report because they supply sugars and calories to the diet when they are added as an ingredient to foods. We explained in the Nutrition Facts label final rule that small amounts of added sugars that are contributed to the diet by a wide variety of foods can add up over the course of the day and can make it difficult for an individual to eat sufficient amounts of foods from the basic food groups to meet nutrient needs without exceeding the amount of calories they need in a day for weight maintenance (81 FR 33742 at 33759). As such, when an ingredient containing mono- and disaccharides that are created through controlled hydrolysis (e.g. maltodextrin or corn syrup) is added to a food during processing, those mono- and disaccharides contributed by the ingredient need to be declared as added sugars on the label (21 CFR 101.9(c)(9)(iii)."

    "Question": "Having read through Guidance for Industry- Interim Procedures for Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food and Human Dietary Supplements , What is a health claim?",
    "Answer": "A health claim is an explicit or implied characterization of a relationship between a substance and a disease or a health-related condition.

    "Answer": "Biological products that do not fall within the specified categories of biological products described in 21 CFR 601.2 (\"non-specified biological products\") are subject to certain additional CMC-related requirements under the PHS Act when seeking marketing approval in a BLA or BLA supplement (see establishment standards described in 21 CFR 600.10, 600.11, 600.12 and 600.13). These requirements differ in some respects from establishment standards under the FD&C Act; however, FDA expects the practical implications for transition biological products tobe minimal. As a preliminary matter, we note that an approved NDA for a biological product will be deemed to be a license (i.e., an approved BLA) for the biological product by operation of the BPCI Act. Accordingly, certain premarket approval requirements may not be applicable unless the application holder seeks approval of a supplement to the deemed BLA and the requirement applies to the supplement (see Q16 below). Moreover, as provided in 21 CFR 601.2, the additional requirements described above are not applicable to the \"specified categories\" of biological products described in that section of the regulations, and many transition biological products will fall within those identified categories of biological products, for which such additional requirements would not be applicable."
