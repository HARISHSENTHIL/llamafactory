    "answers": "Temperature and humidity: Morning hours typically have cooler temperatures and higher humidity levels, which create favorable conditions for effective pesticide application. Low temperatures reduce the risk of evaporation, allowing the pesticide to stay on the plant surfaces longer. Higher humidity helps the pesticide droplets to spread and adhere to the plant surfaces.\n\nWind conditions: Generally, wind speeds are lower during the morning hours, reducing the risk of pesticide drift. Calm or gentle breezes help ensure that the pesticide is applied to the target plants without being carried away to non-target areas.\n\nPest activity: Many pests, such as insects and mites, tend to be more active during the early morning hours. By spraying at this time, the pesticide can directly target and control the pests while they are actively feeding or moving.\n\nPreservation of beneficial insects: Spraying in the morning allows beneficial insects, such as bees and butterflies, to forage on flowers and perform pollination activities during the day. Since these insects are crucial for crop pollination and ecological balance, it is important to minimize their exposure to pesticides. Spraying in the morning allows the pesticide residues to degrade or dry off before the peak activity of beneficial insects."

    "question": "Farmers always ask for the reason why nitrogenous fertilizer are only top dress",
    "answers": "Nitrogen uptake timing: Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for plant growth and is necessary for various physiological processes, including leaf and stem development. However, nitrogen is a highly mobile nutrient in the soil and can easily leach or wash away if applied too early in the growing season. Therefore, to ensure that the plants have an adequate and readily available nitrogen supply during their active growth phase, nitrogenous fertilizers are often applied as top dressing when the plants are well-established.\n\nCrop demand for nitrogen: Many crops, including maize, have a high demand for nitrogen during their vegetative growth stage. By applying nitrogenous fertilizers as top dressing during this period, it helps meet the crop's nutrient requirements when they need it the most. This timing allows for optimal nitrogen utilization by the plants and promotes vigorous vegetative growth.\n\nMinimizing nitrogen losses: By applying nitrogenous fertilizers as top dressing, farmers can better manage and minimize nitrogen losses from leaching or volatilization. Top dressing allows for a more targeted application directly to the root zone, reducing the risk of nutrient runoff or wastage. It also ensures that the nitrogen remains available to the plants when they require it, improving nutrient efficiency and minimizing environmental impacts."
