Many remote and rural regions in low-in come countries remain without access to electricity; animal and human power provide the main energy inputs for farms, while traditional use of biomass or direct solar energy provide energy for the limited processing that is done such as crop drying. No access to electricity affects food production: it also results in high levels of food loss since processing and storage options that need electricity are not available (Sims et al., 2015). High-income countries use more energy in the agriculture sector as they rely more heavily on mechanised farm equipment and a variety of technologies to process and distribute the products that enable them to have higher yields and to sell their output to markets. Access to adequate and reliable modern energy is important for food production. It can improve the productivity of every phase of the agri-food chain, from production to preparation (Figure 1.8)."

To take just one example, a grain dryer introduced in Viet Nam was found to reduce the labour required to dry a tonne of rice from 46 person-hours to 7 person-hours, freeing time for farmers to engage in profitable off-farm activities and lowering the cost of drying from 10% to 4% of crop value (Hodges et al., 2011)."

The ETP buildings sector model employs a global simulation stock accounting model, split into residential and services sub-sectors and applied across 32 countries or regions (Figure B1). The residential sub-sector includes those activities related to individual dwellings. It covers all energy-using activities in apartments and houses, including space and water heating, cooling, lighting, and the use of appliances and electronics."
  },
  {
    "text": "The services sub-sector includes activities related to trade, finance, real estate, public administration, health, food and lodging, education and commercial services. This is also often referred to as the commercial and public service sector. It covers energy used for space heating, cooling and ventilation, water heating, lighting and a number of other miscellaneous energy-using equipment, such as commercial appliances and cooking devices or office equipment."
  },
  {
    "text": "For both sub-sectors, the ETP buildings model uses socio-economic drivers, such as income (approximated as GDP per capita) and population, to project household growth, floor space per capita and appliance ownership (see buildings sector drivers below). As far as possible, country statistics are used for these indicators in historic years, and the IEA continues to work to collect"
  },
  {
    "text": "For OECD non-members, these data are typically more difficult to obtain, and in several cases these parameters have been estimated for the base year using income (approximated by GDP per capita) as a key driver (see methodology below). Once calculated, dwellings, buildings floor area and appliance ownership are differentiated by vintage (year) when possible, and approximations based on other indicators (e.g. historical population) are used to estimate the historic distributions if no statistical data are available for a country or region."
  },
  {
    "text": "Using projections for these key indicators (i.e. buildings demand drivers), the model then determines end-use energy demand (e.g. space heating per square metre), applying useful energy intensities, which take into account the vintage of the buildings and any refurbishment of the buildings stock through corresponding degradation and improvement rates for the useful energy intensities."
  },

In some cases, this initial curve did not fit historic data well (e.g. initial square metres [m2] per capita forecasts in China), and consequently, a second curve was developed to improve the interpolated forecast and to reflect better the historic trend."
  },
  {
    "text": "A slight elasticity was similarly applied to the household occupancy function for China, as the historic one-child policy is likely to have continued impact on household size. For both residential drivers (household size and floor area projections), the IEA and TU continue to work together to improve historic data collection and forecasts to 2050. The IEA and TU are also working on developing a similar function for forecasting services sub-sector floor area growth, which is currently based on an elasticity factor between services floor area and value-added observed in countries where this information is available."
  },
  {
    "text": "Based on this set of drivers, demand for individual energy services and the share of each energy technology needed to meet this demand are projected to 2050. In the services sub-sector, floor area is the driver for estimates of energy consumption for all end-uses. In the case of residential, floor area is the key driver for the development of energy consumption for space heating, space cooling and lighting, while appliances, cooking and water-heating energy consumption are driven by the number of households."
  },
  {
    "text": "Historically, several factors have been the main drivers of final energy use in the buildings sector: population size; buildings sector size (e.g. as measured by floor area or number of households in the residential sub-sector); economic activity (e.g. as measured by gross domestic product [GDP]); and buildings energy policy. Other factors include energy prices and climate. The extent to which each driver contributes to energy use differs from country to country, within countries, and over time according to variations in social, economic, geographic and demographic contexts, as well as in policy environments."

In such a large and diverse country, coal or gas boilers are likely to be used for space heating in many applications for a long time to come.

For this reason, pursuing an R&D plan to develop high-performance gas thermal heat pumps should be a high priority in China, given that they could potentially more than double the current efficiencies for space heating."

Conventional heat pumps that provide high levels of comfort in a wide range of conditions are generally too expensive for low-income rural populations. Initiatives to develop a very low-cost heat pump (heat-only mode) for rural locations that have access to electricity should be a priority in China. This could accelerate the transition away from traditional biofuels and coal use to equipment that can leap-frog conventional electric resistance heaters or other inefficient boiler systems by being more efficient."

The United States has made significant progress on the development of low-cost HPWH technology, with a selling cost that is approximately one-third that in Europe. However, sales in the United States remain around one-fortieth of those in Japan on a per capita basis. Europe\u2019s sales per capita are also very low."

China\u2019s water heating demand per household is very low compared to most developed countries, while Japan has one of the largest hot-water heating demands per capita in the world due to cultural preferences. On the surface, it therefore appears that HPWHs may not be well suited to China. However, in large multi-family buildings, HPWHs can be installed to serve multiple apartment units. This may be a challenge in existing buildings, but they could easily be incorporated in newly constructed buildings."
  },
  {
    "text": "One significant barrier in China is that the purchase of a water-heating unit is seen as a requirement of the apartment owner rather than the builder (a classic example of a split incentive). Generally, most apartments are sold without appliances, water heaters or air conditioners, being the responsibility of the apartment owner. Integrating water heating into the basic building design would therefore change this philosophy and may be resisted by builders. It should, however, be possible through the building energy code process. A large unit providing hot water to several apartments is also likely to require sub-metering to ensure energy conservation behaviour is adopted. These barriers are not insurmountable and will require policy intervention, particularly in the design of new buildings. If these types of hot-water systems are not pursued for new construction designs now, then it may be difficult to implement them later (e.g., alongside urban solar thermal systems and as possible combination units)."

    "text": "Investment in oil supply in the 450 Scenario is 21% lower than in the New Policies Scenario, with the bulk of the reduction coming after 2020. This drop results from the reduced need to bring on new production capacity, including the most costly deepwater offshore oil projects. Upstream investment by OPEC countries, which are together responsible for the bulk of the projected increase in supply, is $310 billion, or 15% lower than in the New Policies Scenario."
