    "output": "Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic input that causes high blood sugar. Your body either doesn\ufffdt make enough insulin or can\ufffdt effectively use the insulin it makes.\nThe hormone insulin moves sugar from the blood into your cells to be stored or used for energy. If this malfunctions, you may have diabetes.\nUntreated high blood sugar from diabetes can damage your nerves, eyes, kidneys, and other organs. But educating yourself about diabetes and taking steps to prevent or manage it can help you protect your health."

It\ufffds also possible that a virus sets off an immune system attack.\nType 2 diabetes\nType 2 diabetes stems from a combination of genetics and lifestyle factors. Having overweight or obesity increases your risk, too. Carrying extra weight, especially in your belly, makes your cells more resistant to the effects of insulin on your blood sugar.\nThis condition runs in families. Family members share genes that make them more likely to get type 2 diabetes and to be overweight.\nType 1.5 diabetes\nType 1.5 is an autoimmune condition that occurs when the pancreas is attacked by your own antibodies. as in type 1. It may be genetic, but more research is needed.\nGestational diabetes\nGestational diabetes occurs as the result of hormonal changes during pregnancy. The placenta produces hormones that make a pregnant person\ufffds cells less sensitive to the effects of insulin.

These might include:\npet dander from animals like cats and dogs\nfood\nmold\npollen\ndust\nAllergic asthma is often seasonal because it goes hand-in-hand with seasonal allergies.\nNon-allergic asthma\nIrritants in the air not related to allergies trigger this type of asthma. These irritants might include:\nburning wood\ncigarette smoke\ncold air\nair pollution\nviral illnesses\nair fresheners\nhousehold cleaning products\nperfumes\nOccupational asthma\nOccupational asthma is a type of asthma induced by triggers in the workplace. These include:\ndust\ndyes\ngases and fumes\nindustrial chemicals\nanimal proteins\nrubber latex\nThese irritants can exist in a wide range of industries, including:\nfarming\ntextiles\nwoodworking\nmanufacturing\nExercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB)\nExercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) usually affects people within a few minutes of starting exercise and up to 10 to 15 minutes after physical activity.\nThis condition was previously known as exercise-induced asthma (EIA).\nUp to 90 percent of people with asthma also experience EIB, but not everyone with EIB will have other types of asthma.\nAspirin-induced asthma\nAspirin-induced asthma (AIA), also called aspirin-exacerbated respiratory input (AERD), is usually severe.\nIt\ufffds triggered by taking aspirin or another NSAID, such as naproxen (Aleve) or ibuprofen (Advil).\nThe symptoms may begin within minutes or hours. People with AIA also typically have nasal polyps.\nAbout 9 percent of people with asthma have AIA. It usually develops suddenly in adults between the ages of 20 and 50.\nNocturnal asthma\nIn this type of asthma, symptoms worsen at night.\nTriggers that are thought to bring on symptoms at night include:\nheartburn\npet dander\ndust mites\nThe body\ufffds natural sleep cycle may also trigger nocturnal asthma.\nCough-variant asthma (CVA)\nCough-variant asthma (CVA) doesn\ufffdt have classic asthma symptoms of wheezing and shortness of breath. It\ufffds characterized by a persistent, dry cough.\nIf it\ufffds not treated, CVA can lead to full-blown asthma flares that include the other more common symptoms."

The symptoms occur more than twice a week \ufffd but not daily \ufffd and up to 4 nights per month.\nModerate persistent. The symptoms occur daily and at least 1 night every week, but not nightly. They may limit some daily activities.\nSevere persistent. The symptoms occur several times every day and most nights. Daily activities are extremely limited.\nTreatments for asthma fall into four primary categories:\nquick relief medications\nlong-term control medications\na combination of quick relief and long-term control medications. The most current asthma clinical guidelines\n, released in 2020 by the NAEPP, recommend this treatment. However this treatment is not yet approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA).\nbiologics, which are given by injection or infusion usually only for severe forms of asthma\nYour doctor will recommend one treatment or a combination of treatments based on:\nthe type of asthma you have\nyour age\nyour triggers\nYour treatment plan may also involve learning your triggers, monitoring your symptoms carefully, and taking steps to avoid flare-ups.\nQuick-relief asthma treatments\nThese medications should only be used in the event of asthma symptoms or an attack. They provide quick relief to help you breathe again.\nBronchodilators\nBronchodilators work within minutes to relax the tightened muscles around your airwaves and decrease symptoms quickly.\nAlthough they can be administered orally or injected, bronchodilators are most commonly taken with an inhaler (rescue) or nebulizer.\nThey can be used to treat sudden symptoms of asthma or taken before exercise to prevent a flare-up.\nFirst aid asthma treatment\nIf you think that someone you know is having an asthma attack, tell them to sit them upright and assist them in using their rescue inhaler or nebulizer.\nThe dosage will vary depending on the medication. Check the instructions insert to make sure you know how many puffs of medications you need in the event of an attack.\nIf symptoms persist for more than 20 minutes, and a second round of medication doesn\ufffdt help, seek emergency medical attention.\nIf you frequently need to use quick-relief medications, ask your doctor about another type of medication for long-term asthma control.\nLong-term asthma control medications\nThese medications are taken daily to help reduce the number and severity of your asthma symptoms, but they don\ufffdt manage the immediate symptoms of an attack.\nLong-term asthma control medications include:\nAnti-inflammatories. Taken with an inhaler, corticosteroids and other anti-inflammatory medications help reduce swelling and mucus production in your airways, making it easier to breathe.\nAnticholinergics. These help stop your muscles from tightening around your airways. They\ufffdre usually taken daily in combination with anti-inflammatories.\nLong-acting bronchodilators. These should only be used in combination with anti-inflammatory asthma medications.\nBiologics\nDoctors use biologics to treat severe asthma that doesn\ufffdt respond to other medications or to treatment by trigger control.\nThey work by targeting specific antibodies in your body. This disrupts the pathway that leads to asthma-causing inflammation.\nThere are five types of biologic medications on the market, and others in development. These medications need to be administered either by injection or by infusion in your doctor\ufffds office.\nBronchial thermoplasty\nThis treatment uses an electrode to heat\nthe airways inside the lungs, helping to reduce the size of the surrounding muscle and prevent it from tightening.\nThis minimally invasive procedure is performed by a doctor in a clinic or hospital and usually takes around an hour.\nBronchial thermoplasty is intended for people with severe asthma and can provide relief from symptoms for up to 5 years\n.\nHowever, because it\ufffds a relatively new procedure, it\ufffds not yet widely available."

They take oxygen-rich blood to your body and all of your organs.\nThe coronary arteries take oxygen-rich blood specifically to your heart muscle. When these arteries become blocked or narrowed due to a buildup of plaque, the blood flow to your heart can decrease significantly or stop completely. This can cause a heart attack."

    "output": "A major trigger for heart problems can be\nthe fat content of food. People who eat a lot of processed and fried foods, as well as some meat and dairy foods that contain unhealthy saturated and trans saturated fats, are at a higher risk for heart input. Obesity can increase this risk.\nAccording to one study, replacing 2 percent\nof calories consumed from carbs with trans fat could double the risk of heart input.\nIn addition, your blood also contains fat known as triglycerides, which store\nexcess energy from the food that you eat. When the level of triglycerides in your blood is high, you may be more at risk for cardiovascular input.\nIf, along with that, you also have a high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in your blood, your risk may be even higher. This is because LDL cholesterol can stick to the walls of your arteries and produce plaque, a hard substance that blocks\nblood flow in the arteries.\nReducing your cholesterol and the unhealthy fat in your body typically requires eating a balanced diet that contains few processed foods, and when necessary, taking medications called statins.\nYour doctor would be able to recommend the best nutrition plan for you and determine whether you need to take medications.\nAdditional risks\nIn addition to your diet, the following factors can also increase your risk of heart problems\n:\nHigh blood pressure. This can damage your arteries and accelerate the buildup of plaque.\nHigh blood sugar levels. Having high levels of blood sugar can damage blood vessels and eventually lead to coronary artery input.\nSmoking. Smoking may increase your risk for heart attack and lead to other cardiovascular conditions and inputs.\nAge. The risk of having a heart attack increases with age. Men are at a higher risk of a heart attack after age 45, and women are at a higher risk of a heart attack after age 55.\nSex. Not only do men have a significantly higher risk of having a heart attack than women, but they also often have heart attacks earlier in life.\nFamily history. You\ufffdre more likely to have a heart attack if you have a family history of early heart input. Your risk is especially high if you have male family members who developed heart input before age 55 or if you have female family members who developed heart input before age 65.\nStress. Although the evidence for this is still limited, stress may also\nbe a trigger for acute myocardial infarction. Reducing chronic anxiety or stress can help reduce the risk of a heart attack and other heart problems over time.\nPhysical inactivity. Getting regular exercise can help keep your heart healthy by helping you maintain a moderate weight, as well as reduce your blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels.\nDrug use. The use of certain drugs, including cocaine and amphetamines, can narrow the blood vessels, which could increase the risk of heart attack.\nPreeclampsia. If you have a history of preeclampsia, or high blood pressure during pregnancy, you may be at a higher risk of developing heart problems later in life."

The stent can prevent the artery from closing again.\nYour doctor may also want to perform a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). In this procedure, your surgeon will restore blood flow by rerouting your veins and arteries so the blood can move around the blockage.\nA CABG is sometimes done immediately after a heart attack. In most cases, however, it\ufffds performed several days after the incident so your heart has time to heal.\nAnother procedure your doctor may want you to undergo is a bypass surgery, which is used\nto form new passages for blood to flow to the heart.\nA number of different medications can also be used to treat a heart attack:\nBlood thinners, such as aspirin, are often used to break up blood clots and improve blood flow through narrowed arteries.\nThrombolytics are often used to dissolve clots.\nAntiplatelet drugs, such as clopidogrel, can be used to prevent new clots from forming and existing clots from growing.\nNitroglycerin can be used to widen your blood vessels.\nBeta-blockers lower your blood pressure and relax your heart muscle.

    "output": "Hypothyroidism occurs when your body doesn\ufffdt produce enough thyroid hormones. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland that sits in front of your windpipe. It releases hormones that help your body regulate and use energy.\nThyroid hormones help control functions including how your heart beats and how your digestive system works. Without the right amount of thyroid hormones, your body\ufffds natural functions begin to slow down.\nAlso called underactive thyroid, hypothyroidism usually affects people over the age of 60 and is more common in women than men. It may be discovered through a routine blood test or after symptoms begin.\nSubclinical hypothyroidism is the name given to an early, mild form of the condition.\nIf you\ufffdve recently received a hypothyroidism diagnosis, it\ufffds important to know that treatment is considered simple, safe, and effective.\nMost treatments rely on supplementing your low hormone levels with artificial hormones. These hormones will replace what your body isn\ufffdt producing on its own and help return your body\ufffds functions to normal.\nHypothyroidism vs. hyperthyroidism\nHypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism have opposite effects. With hyperthyroidism, or overactive thyroid, the thyroid gland makes too much thyroid hormone.\nThe greater amount of thyroid hormone causes some functions in your body to become faster, like your heart rate. You may also experience weight loss and difficulty sleeping.\nHyperthyroidism is less common than hypothyroidism. It affects around 1 percent\nof people ages 12 and older in the United States.

The severity of the condition also affects which signs and symptoms appear and when.\nEarly symptoms can include weight gain and fatigue. Note that these both become more common as you age, regardless of your thyroid\ufffds health.\nAs a result, you may not realize that these changes are related to your thyroid until more symptoms appear. For instance, these may include skin changes associated with hypothyroidism, like scaly, rough, and dry skin and fragile nails.\nIn general, the most common signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism include:\nfatigue\nweight gain\ndepression\nconstipation\nfeeling cold\ndecreased sweating\nslowed heart rate\nelevated blood cholesterol\ndry skin\ndry, thinning hair\nimpaired memory\nmuscle weakness\nmuscle stiffness, aches, and tenderness\npain and stiffness in your joints\nFor most people, symptoms of the condition progress gradually over many years. As the thyroid slows more and more, the symptoms may become more easily identified. Of course, many of these symptoms also become more common with age in general.\nIf you suspect your symptoms are the result of a thyroid problem, talk with your doctor. They can order a blood test to determine whether you have hypothyroidism.\nIf you don\ufffdt already have a primary care doctor, you can browse doctors in your area through the Healthline FindCare tool.\nHypothyroidism symptoms in adults\nBesides the most common hypothyroidism symptoms, research\nindicates that hypothyroidism symptoms in men may also include erectile dysfunction.\nHypothyroidism symptoms in women may additionally include:\nfertility difficulties\nmenstrual changes, particularly irregular or heavy periods\nproblems during pregnancy, including anemia\nIt\ufffds also possible to develop hypothyroidism during pregnancy. Symptoms will usually be similar to those of other cases of hypothyroidism.\nHypothyroidism in young people\nWhile hypothyroidism is less common in younger people, it can still occur. The condition may cause slower development in children and early puberty in teenagers.\nBabies may also be born lacking thyroid function, a condition called congenital hypothyroidism. Symptoms of hypothyroidism in infants may include:\nsleeping more than usual\nconstipation\ndifficulty with feeding\ndelayed growth (if the condition is untreated)\nIn some cases, babies with hypothyroidism may show no symptoms.\nSevere hypothyroidism symptoms\nIf hypothyroidism isn\ufffdt treated, you may develop additional symptoms:\npuffy, sensitive face\nhoarseness\nanemia\nloss of hearing\nIn rare cases, severe hypothyroidism may result in myxedema coma, a life threatening condition that requires emergency care.

When unknown bacteria or viruses enter your body, your immune system responds by sending fighter cells to destroy the foreign cells.\nSometimes, your body confuses normal, healthy cells for invading cells. This is called an autoimmune response. If the autoimmune response isn\ufffdt regulated or treated, your immune system can attack healthy tissues. This can cause serious medical issues, including conditions such as hypothyroidism.\nHashimoto\ufffds thyroiditis is an autoimmune condition and the most common cause\nof an underactive thyroid in the United States. This input attacks your thyroid gland, causing damage that reduces thyroid function.\nIt most often affects middle-aged women, but it can occur in men and children. This condition also runs in families. If a family member has received a diagnosis of this input, then your risk of having it is higher.\nRadioactive iodine treatment for hyperthyroidism\nIf your thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, you have a condition known as hyperthyroidism. Treatment for this condition aims to reduce and regulate thyroid hormone production.\nStandard treatment for hyperthyroidism uses radioactive iodine to destroy thyroid cells. This may cause the levels of your thyroid hormone to remain low permanently.\nSurgical removal of your thyroid\nIf your entire thyroid gland is removed as a result of thyroid problems, you\ufffdll develop hypothyroidism. Using thyroid medication long term is the primary treatment.\nIf only a portion of the gland is removed, your thyroid may still be able to produce enough hormones on its own. Blood tests will help determine how much thyroid medication you may need.\nRadiation therapy\nIf you\ufffdve received a diagnosis of cancer of the head or neck, lymphoma, or leukemia, you may have undergone radiation therapy. Radiation used for the treatment of these conditions may slow or halt the production of thyroid hormone, leading to hypothyroidism.\nMedications\nSeveral medications may lower thyroid hormone production, resulting in hypothyroidism. These include ones used to treat mental health conditions, cancer, or heart input, such as:\nlithium, which treats mania in bipolar disorder\ninterleukin-2 (IL-2), an immunotherapy drug\nanti-CTLA-4 medications, which treat melanoma\namiodarone (Pacerone), an antiarrhythmic drug\nstavudine, a medication for HIV\nIodine deficiency\nIodine deficiency occurs infrequently in the United States, but it is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in other parts of the world. Iodine, which is needed to produce thyroid hormone, is found in foods including:\niodized salt\ndairy\nseafood\neggs\nIf you have iodine deficiency, you may develop swelling at the base of your neck. This is called a goiter. It\ufffds caused by an enlarged thyroid gland.\nPituitary disorders\nHypothyroidism may also result from problems involving the pituitary gland. This small gland in the brain produces hormones that affect many bodily functions, including the thyroid gland.\nProblems with the pituitary gland may cause thyroid issues. Pituitary disorders may result from:\npituitary tumors\nmedications like dopamine and opioids\nradiation therapy around the brain\nSheehan syndrome, which damages the pituitary gland\nThis type of hypothyroidism is called secondary hypothyroidism because the thyroid gland functions normally. It\ufffds less common than primary hypothyroidism, which is caused by a problem with the thyroid gland.\nCongenital input\nCongenital hypothyroidism is hypothyroidism that\ufffds present in children from birth. It affects between 1 in 2,000 and 1 in 4,000 newborns and is twice as common in females.\nThe condition occurs when the thyroid gland develops abnormally or is not present at all. Genetics or iodine deficiency may cause this. While some babies may show no symptoms, others will be less active or have trouble feeding.\nU.S. hospitals test newborns for the condition. It\ufffds important to treat congenital hypothyroidism to prevent it from delaying growth or mental development.\nPregnancy\nAround 5\nto 10 percent\nof pregnant people will develop postpartum thyroiditis several months after their pregnancy. While only some will need treatment, others will develop permanent hypothyroidism.\nThe following can increase the risk of postpartum thyroiditis:\nhistory of postpartum thyroiditis\npresence of antibodies to thyroid peroxidase in the blood\ntype 1 diabetes\nDe Quervain thyroiditis\nAn upper respiratory infection that damages thyroid cells may cause De Quervain thyroiditis, an uncommon condition that is also called subacute granulomatous thyroiditis. It\ufffds most common in women and often occurs during the summer and fall\n.\nSymptoms of de Quervain thyroiditis include:\npain in the neck, jaw, and throat\nenlarged, tender thyroid gland\nfever\nfatigue\nbody pain\nThe condition may cause hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism and last 2 to 8 weeks.

They\ufffdll check for physical signs of hypothyroidism, including:\ndry skin\nslowed reflexes\nswelling in the neck\na slower heart rate\nIn addition, your doctor will ask you to report any symptoms you\ufffdve been experiencing, such as fatigue, constipation, or constantly feeling cold.\nIf you have a known family history of thyroid conditions, tell your doctor during this exam.\nBlood tests\nBlood tests are the only way to reliably confirm a diagnosis of hypothyroidism.\nA thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test measures how much TSH your pituitary gland is creating:\nIf your thyroid isn\ufffdt producing enough hormones, the pituitary gland will boost TSH to increase thyroid hormone production. The high TSH levels indicate hypothyroidism.\nIf you have hyperthyroidism, your TSH levels will be low, as your body is trying to stop excessive thyroid hormone production.\nA thyroxine (T4) level test is also useful in diagnosing hypothyroidism. T4 is one of the hormones directly produced by your thyroid. Used together, T4 and TSH tests can help evaluate thyroid function.\nTypically, if you have a low level of T4 along with a high level of TSH, you have hypothyroidism. If you have subclinical hypothyroidism, though, you may have normal T4 with a high TSH level.\nSince there\ufffds a spectrum of thyroid input, other thyroid function tests may be necessary to properly diagnose your condition.\nIf your T4 test is normal, you may also receive a triiodothyronine (T3) test. Low T3 levels may indicate hypothyroidism, though again, T3 levels may be normal in subclinical hypothyroidism.\nFinally, thyroid antibody tests look for antibodies in your blood to diagnose autoimmune thyroid disorders like Hashimoto\ufffds thyroiditis."

This synthetic version of the T4 hormone copies the action of the thyroid hormone your body would normally produce.\nThe medication is designed to return adequate levels of thyroid hormone to your blood. Once hormone levels are restored, symptoms of the condition are likely to disappear or at least become much more manageable.\nOnce you start treatment, it will take several weeks before you\ufffdll begin feeling relief. You\ufffdll require follow-up blood tests to monitor your progress. You and your doctor will work together to find a dose and a treatment plan that best addresses your symptoms. This can take some time.\nIn most cases, people with hypothyroidism must remain on this medication their entire lives. However, the amount you take may need to be adjusted, especially if you have Hashimoto\ufffds thyroiditis.

Most people will gain somewhere between 5 and 10 pounds.\nProperly treating the condition may lead you to lose any weight you gained while your thyroid levels were not treated. However, keep in mind that that\ufffds not always the case. Symptoms of an underactive thyroid, including weight gain, often develop over a long period of time and may not be caused by a thyroid disorder alone.\nIf your weight stays the same, it doesn\ufffdt mean the condition isn\ufffdt being properly treated. Instead, it may indicate that your weight gain was the result of lifestyle or other conditions rather than low hormone levels."

A Doppler ultrasound helps a healthcare team establish whether blood flow is slowed or blocked, a possible sign that indicates a blood clot.\nVenogram: If a D-dimer test and ultrasound cannot confirm a DVT diagnosis, a doctor may use a venogram or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A venogram involves injecting a liquid called a contrast dye into a vein in your foot. The dye moves up the leg. The dye shows on an X-ray, which pinpoints a gap in the blood vessel where the clot stops the blood flow.\nAccording to a 2019 review of over 40 studies, a venogram is the \ufffdgold standard\ufffd for a DVT diagnosis."

When you become hot, your sweat glands activate to release moisture from your body in an attempt to cool it off. The way this works is by evaporation.\nAs a drop of sweat evaporates from your skin, it takes a small amount of heat with it. The more sweat you produce, the more evaporation there is, and the more you\ufffdre cooled off. Sweating also hydrates your skin and maintains the balance of electrolytes in your body.\nThe fluid you sweat comprises mainly salt and water. Excessive sweating can cause dehydration since you lose a large amount of water.

Therefore, people with kidney problems will likely not be able to have this test because contrast may cause or worsen kidney input. When a CTPA can not be performed, the doctor may instead consider a VQ scan to diagnose a PE.\nVentilation/perfusion scan (VQ). A VQ scan is carried out in two parts. In the first part, radioactive material is breathed in, and pictures are taken to look at the airflow in your lungs.

This is not recommended as a first-line test for diagnosing PE, but it may be an imaging option to diagnose PE in people who can neither receive a CTPA nor a VQ scan. Potential advantages of MRPA are that no ionizing radiation is involved, and the examination can be combined with MR venography in the same sitting to look for DVT.\nVenography.

    "output": "The three\nmajor types are focal onset seizures, generalized onset seizures, and unknown onset seizures.\nFocal onset seizures\nFocal onset seizures begin in only one area\nof the brain. People may also refer to these as partial seizures.\nFocal onset seizures start in small areas of the brain, such as a single lobe, but can affect large areas.\nMedical professionals typically split focal onset seizures into two types: focal aware seizures and focal awareness-impaired seizures.\nFocal aware seizure\nDuring a focal aware seizure, you\ufffdll remain fully conscious and be aware that something is happening, even if you don\ufffdt recognize it as a seizure.\nThe symptoms of a focal aware seizure will depend on which part of the brain the seizure starts.\nFocal aware seizures may be singular events but can also develop into other types of seizures. For this reason, people often refer to them as warnings or auras.\nFocal impaired-awareness seizure\nThis type of seizure affects your consciousness. During a focal impaired-awareness seizure, you may not be able to move, talk, or hear as you did before. You may also not be able to remember the event.\nFocal impaired-awareness seizures can last for up to 2 minutes\n. This type of seizure typically affects a larger portion of the brain than focal aware seizures.\nGeneralized onset seizures\nThese seizures start in both sides of the brain simultaneously. Among the more common types of generalized onset seizures are:\nTonic: Tonic seizures will result in your muscles stiffening up.\nClonic: The convulsions in clonic seizures may cause abnormal, jerky movements of your limbs. You will likely lose consciousness during these seizures that can last for a few minutes.\nTonic-clonic: Tonic-clonic seizures include a combination of both tonic and clonic symptoms.\nMyoclonic: During a myoclonic seizure you may experience sudden muscle spasms. These are typically too short-lived to affect consciousness and pass quickly. Myoclonic seizures may be of generalized onset as well as focal onset.\nAbsence: People may also refer to these as petit mal seizures. Absence seizures last for only a few seconds. They can cause you to blink repeatedly or stare into space. Other people may mistakenly think you\ufffdre daydreaming.\nAtonic: During atonic seizures your muscles suddenly go limp. Your head may nod, or your entire body could fall to the ground. Atonic seizures are brief, lasting about 15 seconds. People may refer to these seizures as drop attacks.\nUnknown onset seizures\nSometimes no one witnesses the beginning of a seizure. For example, someone may wake up in the middle of the night and observe their partner having a seizure."

These can range from a drop in quality of life to increased risks of mental health conditions.\nShort-term effects\nSome seizures can cause you to lose total control of your body. This can lead to falls and other movements that can result in injury.\nPeople with epilepsy typically have more\nphysical issues, such as bruising and fractures, than people without the condition.\nBeing prone to seizures may also affect your quality of life. For example, you may no longer be able to drive. You may want to avoid situations where a seizure could cause serious harm, such as swimming or traveling alone.\nIt\ufffds important to wear a medical identification bracelet that tells emergency responders that you have epilepsy.\nLong-term effects\nIf you don\ufffdt get treatment for seizures, their symptoms can become worse and progressively last longer. Prolonged seizures can lead to coma or death.\nWhile death as a direct result of seizures is rare, the risk of premature death in people with epilepsy is up to three times higher\nthan in the general population.\nLiving with epilepsy can have an impact on your mental health. People living with epilepsy may be depressed or anxious due to the worry of having a seizure. They may also feel isolated, be worried about getting hurt or experience stigma.\nThe changes in the brain that can cause epilepsy may be associated with the different brain changes that can cause psychiatric comorbidities.

    "output": "Your doctor may recommend specific tests to accurately diagnose a seizure and help ensure that the treatments they recommend will be effective.\nYour doctor will consider your complete medical history and the events leading up to the seizure. For example, migraine, headaches, sleep disorders, and extreme psychological stress can cause seizure-like symptoms.\nLab tests may help your doctor rule out other conditions that can cause seizure-like activity. The tests may include:\nblood testing to check for electrolyte imbalances\na spinal tap to rule out infection\na toxicology screening to test for drugs, poisons, or toxins\nAn electroencephalogram (EEG) can help your doctor diagnose a seizure. This test measures your brain waves. Viewing brain waves during a seizure can help your doctor diagnose the type of seizure. An EEG can show evidence of seizure activity even when a person isn\ufffdt having a seizure. But an EEG can also be completely normal when a person is not having a seizure.\nImaging scans, such as a CT scan or MRI scan, can also help by providing a clear picture of the brain.

    "output": "Treatments for seizures depend on the cause. By treating the cause of the seizures, you may be able to prevent future seizures from occurring. The treatment for seizures due to epilepsy include:\nMedications\nAntiepileptic drugs are often the first treatment option for people experiencing multiple seizures. They target the signaling activities in specific brain cells and can effectively control seizures in approximately 70% of cases.\nThere are several types of antiepileptic drugs. You and your doctor may have to work to find out which is the best medication for treating your condition.\nBrain surgery\nDoctors may recommend surgical options for treating epilepsy and seizures if medications don\ufffdt work.\nSurgical procedures to treat epilepsy include:\nresective surgery\nmultiple subpial transection\nhemispherectomy\ncorpus callosotomy\nBrain surgery for epilepsy can improve quality of life but does carry a risk of complications. Consult with your doctor to discuss whether surgery is the right option for you.\nNerve stimulation\nIn addition to brain surgery, surgeons can insert nerve stimulation devices in the body to treat epilepsy.\nVagus nerve stimulation involves placing electrodes around the vagus nerve in your neck and a generator for these electrodes in the upper chest. These devices then stimulate the nerve with electrical signals, which can help manage seizures.\nResponsive neurostimulation systems also work by stimulating the brain to manage seizures. Doctors can program these devices to assess and respond to nerve activity associated with seizures, often stopping them.\nThese less invasive surgical options can help safely reduce seizure frequency and severity.\nDoctors may also suggest deep brain stimulation therapy. This is where a surgeon places electrodes onto the thalamus.\nThe thalamus is a part of the brain that processes signals from almost every sensory system. It regulates consciousness, alertness, and sleep cycles.\nElectrical signals from these electrodes help regulate the excitability of certain parts of the brain. This can help reduce the frequency of seizures.\nDiet changes\nDietary changes may help people manage epilepsy and reduce seizure frequency long term.\nIf antiepileptic drugs don\ufffdt work, following a ketogenic diet can be an alternative to surgery for some people living with epilepsy.\nMultiple studies\nhave linked the diet to positive outcomes in symptom management. However, the exact reasons why it helps people with epilepsy are not known.\nHowever, the ketogenic diet and its variants can feel restrictive. Following the diet long term may be challenging for some.\nBe sure to check in with your doctor before starting a new diet, especially as a mode of treatment."

    "output": "Cardiomyopathy generally has four types:\nDilated cardiomyopathy. Also sometimes called \ufffdenlarged heart,\ufffd dilated cardiomyopathy occurs when your heart muscle enlarges, or dilates, and may be too weak to pump blood efficiently. You can inherit it, or it can be the result of coronary artery input. It\ufffds the most common type of cardiomyopathy.\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is believed to be genetic, occurs when your heart walls thicken and prevent blood from flowing through your heart. This stiffens your heart and increases your risk of electrical problems. Long-term high blood pressure, aging, diabetes, or thyroid input can also cause acquired types of hypertension-related cardiomyopathy. In some instances, the cause is unknown.\nArrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD). This is a very rare form of cardiomyopathy, but it\ufffds the leading cause of sudden death in young athletes. In this type of genetic cardiomyopathy, fat and extra fibrous tissue replace the muscle of the right ventricle. This causes abnormal heart rhythms and abnormalities in the function of the right ventricle.\nRestrictive cardiomyopathy. Restrictive cardiomyopathy occurs when the ventricles stiffen and can\ufffdt relax enough to fill up with blood. Heart input, scarring of the heart, and cardiac amyloid, which frequently occurs after a heart transplant, are thought to be possible causes.\nOther types of cardiomyopathy\nMost of the following types of cardiomyopathy belong to one of the previous four classifications, but each has unique causes or complications:\nPeripartum cardiomyopathy. Peripartum cardiomyopathy occurs during or after pregnancy. This rare type occurs when the heart weakens within 5 months of delivery or within the final month of pregnancy. When it occurs after delivery, it\ufffds sometimes called postpartum cardiomyopathy. This is a form of dilated cardiomyopathy, and it\ufffds a life threatening condition. Having it once increases your risk with other pregnancies.\nAlcoholic cardiomyopathy. Alcoholic cardiomyopathy is due to drinking too much alcohol over a long period of time, which can weaken your heart so it can no longer pump blood efficiently. Your heart can also become enlarged. This is a form of dilated cardiomyopathy.\nIschemic cardiomyopathy. Ischemic cardiomyopathy occurs when your heart can no longer pump blood to the rest of your body due to coronary artery input. Blood vessels to the heart muscle narrow and become blocked. This keeps oxygen from getting to the heart muscle. Ischemic cardiomyopathy is a common cause of heart failure. Alternatively, nonischemic cardiomyopathy is any form that isn\ufffdt related to coronary artery input.\nNoncompaction cardiomyopathy. This is also known as spongiform cardiomyopathy. It\ufffds a rare input present at birth and is caused by abnormal development of the heart muscle in the womb. Diagnosis may occur at any stage of life.\nPediatric cardiomyopathy. When cardiomyopathy affects a child, it\ufffds called pediatric cardiomyopathy.\nIdiopathic cardiomyopathy. If you have idiopathic cardiomyopathy, it means the cause is unknown.\nQ: Is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy dominant or recessive?\nAnonymous\nA: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common genetic heart disorder.\nIt\ufffds inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This means that only a single copy of the mutated gene is needed to cause the disorder.\nSarcomere gene mutations are the primary genetic cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Normally, sarcomere genes work to encode proteins that are responsible for helping the heart muscle contract and relax properly. A genetic mutation impairs the gene\ufffds ability to function properly.\nMore than 2,000 sarcomere mutations have been identified to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, not everyone who has a sarcomere gene mutation will develop this condition.\nUzochukwu Ibe, MD, MPH, ABIM board certified internal medicine physician and general cardiologist\noutputs represent the opinions of our medical experts.

    "output": "If you have high blood pressure, diabetes, or another condition that puts you at higher risk of kidney failure, a doctor will likely routinely monitor your kidney function.\nRegular checkups and reporting symptoms can help doctors diagnose chronic kidney failure early.\nPhysical exam\nAt your appointment, a doctor will perform a physical exam.\nKidney failure can cause fluids to back up in your lungs or heart. A doctor may examine these organs by listening to them with a stethoscope.\nBlood and urine tests\nIf a doctor thinks you might have chronic kidney failure, they will likely order blood and urine tests.\nBlood tests for kidney function measure the levels of electrolytes and waste in your blood. They measure waste products such as. These can include:\nCreatinine: Creatinine is a byproduct of muscle metabolism.\nBlood urea: Blood urea is left over when your body breaks down proteins.\nWhen your kidneys are working properly, they excrete both substances.\nUrine tests can measure your kidney function.\nA urine protein test measures how much protein is in your urine. Urine typically contains only trace amounts of protein. An elevated protein level may indicate kidney problems months or even years before other symptoms appear.\nImaging tests\nImaging tests can provide structural details of your kidneys. These can include:\nkidney ultrasound\nMRI\nCT scan\nBiopsy\nA doctor may also order a biopsy. This can be performed as a needle biopsy or an open biopsy.\nA needle biopsy is the most common type of kidney biopsy. During this procedure, a doctor or technician inserts a needle into your kidney. This is considered a minimally invasive procedure.\nDuring an open biopsy, a doctor will use a surgical incision to expose your kidney. This procedure requires strict sterile techniques and general anesthesia.\nAfter the doctor collects a sample of kidney tissue, they will send it to a lab for microscopic examination.\nTesting results and follow-up\nThe results of your examination will help the doctor make a diagnosis. It can also help them determine the cause of your kidney failure.\nIf you receive a diagnosis of chronic kidney failure, you will likely need regular blood tests. These measure various substances in your body, such as:\ncalcium\npotassium\ncholesterol\nsodium\nmagnesium\nphosphorous\nYou may also need ongoing kidney function tests to measure your creatinine and urea levels."

However, certain measures can slow its progression.\nMedication\nMedication can help treat the symptoms of chronic kidney failure.\nKidney failure is linked to high blood pressure, so a doctor may prescribe medication to lower your blood pressure. You might also need medications called statins to lower your cholesterol level.\nPeople with chronic kidney failure may also experience anemia. Anemia occurs when your body doesn\ufffdt produce enough red blood cells. Treatments for anemia can include:\na supplement to help increase your red blood cell production\niron pills or shots to help your body manufacture blood cells\na blood transfusion to improve your red blood cell health, in some cases\nIf your kidney problem causes fluid retention, medications called diuretics can help relieve your swelling. This medication makes you urinate frequently.\nA doctor may also prescribe medication to support your bone health. This can include:\ncalcium supplements\nvitamin D supplements, as vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption\nphosphate binders, as high levels of phosphate can reduce calcium absorption\nAntihistamines can help relieve itchy skin and antiemetics can help with nausea.\nDiet\nA doctor may also recommend certain dietary changes, including reducing your intake of certain nutrients.\nThese can include\n:\nProtein: As your body processes protein, it creates waste products. Your kidneys are responsible for filtering this waste. A lower protein diet makes their job easier.\nPotassium: When your kidneys are not functioning well, they may not filter potassium properly. In people with chronic kidney failure, high levels of potassium (hyperkalemia) can be life threatening. It can lead to issues with heart function or paralysis. Doctors may recommend a low potassium diet.\nPhosphate: Your kidneys may not be able to process phosphate either. Phosphate can also diminish your body\ufffds ability to absorb calcium. High phosphate foods include fish, dairy products, eggs, and meat. You may need to eat less of these.\nSalt and sodium: Consuming too much sodium can make it hard for your body to maintain fluid levels. Reading labels may help you manage your intake. Many prepared foods, such as canned soup or fast food, can be high in sodium.\nYou can work with a dietitian or a doctor to find out how much of these substances you should eat.\nYou may also need to limit your fluid intake so your kidneys don\ufffdt have to work too hard.\nPeople with chronic kidney failure often lose weight. Make sure you\ufffdre consuming enough calories from foods approved and recommended by a dietitian.\nLifestyle\nCertain lifestyle practices may help slow the progression of chronic kidney input. These can include:\nquitting smoking, if you smoke\nkeeping up to date on your vaccinations, including your flu shot\ndiscuss supplements and over-the-counter (OTC) medications with a doctor before taking them\nIf you see other doctors for different conditions, always inform them of your kidney situation.\nEnd stage treatment\nIf attempts to control your condition through diet and medication fail, you might face end stage kidney input.\nEnd stage kidney input, also known as end stage renal input (ESRD), occurs when your kidneys operate at less than 15%\nof their full capacity. At this stage, your kidneys can no longer eliminate waste as fast as you produce it.\nThere are two treatment options for end stage kidney input: dialysis and kidney transplant.Doctors typically try to postpone these options as long as possible because both carry serious risks.\nDialysis\nDialysis is a system for filtering waste products and excess fluids out of your blood.\nThe two main types of dialysis include:\nHemodialysis: In hemodialysis, your blood is filtered outside your body in a machine.\nPeritoneal dialysis: In peritoneal dialysis, you fill your abdominal cavity with a special solution via a catheter. The solution absorbs excess fluid and waste before it\ufffds drained from your body.\nBecause dialysis usually needs to be done several times a week, it\ufffds a big lifestyle change. Dialysis also carries a risk of infection.\nKidney transplant\nKidney transplant is more convenient than dialysis if you can find an appropriate donor kidney. The donor needs to have the same blood type as you.\nA kidney from a living sibling or other close relative is usually best. You could also get your kidney from a deceased donor.\nHowever, kidney transplants also carry a large risk of infection because you will need lifelong immunosuppression."

    "output": "Treatment for basal cell carcinoma involves removing the growth. Your doctor will recommend a treatment depending on the type of BCC you have, the size of the lesion, and the location of the lesion. Treatment options include:\nCurettage and electrodessication\nIn this procedure, the growth is scraped off with a curette. The tumor site is then burned with an electrocautery needle. It is extremely effective, especially on small lesions, though it may not be as effective on aggressive BCCs or high-risk sites. It can leave a round, white scar. This procedure has a 95 percent success rate.\nExcisional surgery\nYour doctor will remove the tumor and surrounding border of normal skin around it with a scalpel. This procedure requires stitches to close the surgical site. This is often used for more advanced BCCs, which are at risk for affecting the surrounding skin. It may leave a small scar. This procedure has a 95 percent success rate.\nMohs micrographic surgery\nYour doctor will remove a thin layer of tissue that contains the tumor. The layer of tissue is frozen and then mapped under a microscope. The doctor will then repeat the procedure on the exact location the cancer was present.\nThis procedure can save healthy tissue, and has the highest cure rate at about 99 percent. It\ufffds often used for large tumors, or tumors in highly visible areas like the face or neck.\nCryosurgery\nCryosurgery is used for cancers that are thin and don\ufffdt extend far into the skin. Your doctor can freeze and kill cancerous cells with liquid nitrogen. This has a risk of nerve damage at the site, which can result in loss of feeling.\nNo cutting is necessary, though anesthesia may be used. The growth will blister or crust over. Cryosurgery is most often used for BCC and people with bleeding disorders. It has a success rate of between 85 and 90 percent."

Mania symptoms can affect your day-to-day life at work or home. Hypomania symptoms typically don\ufffdt cause as much disruption, but they can still be distressing.\nSome people living with bipolar disorder also experience major depressive episodes or \ufffddown\ufffd moods.\nThese three main symptoms \ufffd mania, hypomania, and depression \ufffd are the main features of bipolar disorder. Different types of bipolar disorder involve different combinations of these symptoms.\nBipolar I symptoms\nAccording to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5)\n, a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder requires the following:\nat least one episode of mania that lasts at least 1 week\nsymptoms that affect daily function\nsymptoms that don\ufffdt relate to another medical or mental health condition or substance use\nYou could also experience symptoms of psychosis or both mania and depression (known as mixed features).

You could also experience mixed mood episodes, which means you\ufffdll have symptoms of depression and hypomania simultaneously.\nWith bipolar II, though, you won\ufffdt experience mania. If you have a manic episode, you\ufffdll receive a diagnosis of bipolar I.\nCyclothymia symptoms\nA diagnosis of cyclothymia requires:\nperiods of hypomanic symptoms and periods of depression symptoms, off and on, over 2 years or longer\n(1 year\nfor children and adolescents)\nsymptoms that never meet the full criteria for an episode of hypomania or depression\nsymptoms that are present for at least half of the 2 years and never absent for longer than 2 months at a time\nsymptoms that don\ufffdt relate to another medical or mental health condition or substance use\nsymptoms that cause significant distress and affect daily life\nFluctuating mood symptoms characterize cyclothymia. These symptoms may be less severe than those of bipolar I or II. Still, they tend to last longer, so you\ufffdll generally have less time when you experience no symptoms.\nHypomania may not have a big impact on your daily life. Depression, on the other hand, often leads to more serious distress and affects day-to-day function, even if your symptoms don\ufffdt qualify for a major depressive episode.\nIf you do experience enough symptoms to meet the criteria for a hypomanic or depressive episode, your diagnosis will likely change to another type of bipolar disorder or major depression, depending on your symptoms."

If circulation isn\ufffdt restored quickly, brain damage can be permanent.\nIschemic stroke is also called brain ischemia and cerebral ischemia. The blockage caused by this stroke reduces the blood flow and oxygen to the brain, leading to damage or death of brain cells. Approximately 87 percent of all strokes are ischemic strokes.\nAnother type of major stroke is hemorrhagic stroke, in which a blood vessel in the brain ruptures and causes bleeding. The bleeding compresses brain tissue, damaging or killing it.\nThe third type of stroke is transient ischemic attack (TIA), also known as a ministroke. This type of stroke is caused by a temporary blockage or decreased blood flow to the brain. Symptoms usually disappear on their own."

This blockage can appear at the neck or in the skull.\nClots usually start in the heart and travel through the circulatory system. A clot can break up on its own or become lodged in an artery. When it blocks a brain artery, the brain doesn\ufffdt get enough blood or oxygen, and cells start to die.\nIschemic stroke caused by a fatty buildup happens when plaque breaks off from an artery and travels to the brain. Plaque can also build up in the arteries that supply blood to the brain and narrow those arteries enough to cause ischemic stroke.\nGlobal ischemia, which is a more severe type of ischemic stroke, happens when the flow of oxygen to the brain is greatly reduced or completely stopped. This is usually caused by a heart attack, but it can also be caused by other conditions or events, such as carbon monoxide poisoning."

Your doctor may prescribe a combination of treatment methods to achieve the best results.\nMedications\nA number of different types of medication treat arthritis:\nAnalgesics, such as hydrocodone (Vicodin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol), are effective for pain management, but do not help decrease inflammation.\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Advil) and salicylates, help manage pain and inflammation. Salicylates can thin the blood, so they should not be used with additional blood thinning medications.\nMenthol or capsaicin creams. These creams block the transmission of pain signals from your joints.\nSteroids, like prednisone, help reduce inflammation but should be used cautiously and for brief periods of time.\nImmunosuppressants and biologics. Immunosuppressants and biologics are prescribed for moderate to severe inflammatory arthritis like RA.\nIf you have RA, your doctor may recommend corticosteroids or input-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), which suppress your immune system.\nDMARDs and biologics are being prescribed earlier in the course of RA. Methotrexate is now a first-line drug for treatment.\nThere are also many medications to treat OA available over the counter or by prescription.\nSupplements\nWhile clinical evidence and safety data\nare lacking for many herbs and supplements marketed for arthritis, there are a few supplements that may be beneficial. For example, avocado and soybean unsaponifiables (ASU) may help OA symptoms. Fish oil and turmeric supplements may help reduce inflammation in RA.\nHowever, you should talk with your doctor before taking any supplements for arthritis to make sure they are safe for you and will not interact with any medications you\ufffdre currently taking.\nSurgery\nSurgery to replace your joint with an artificial one may be an option. This form of surgery is most commonly performed to replace hips and knees.\nIf your arthritis is most severe in your fingers or wrists, your doctor may perform joint fusion. In this procedure, the ends of your bones are fused, eliminating the joint and therefore eliminating the site of inflammation.\nPhysical therapy\nPhysical therapy involving exercises that help strengthen the muscles around the affected joint is a core component of arthritis treatment.\nOutside of your appointments, your physical therapist will likely recommend a plan of care that includes daily movement along with exercises you can complete on your own at home. Collectively, these can help build strength, flexibility, and balance to improve mobility while also preventing falls."

The most common causes of stress incontinence among women are pregnancy and childbirth, especially having multiple vaginal deliveries. During pregnancy and childbirth, the sphincter and pelvic muscles stretch out and are weakened.\nOlder age and conditions that cause a chronic cough can also cause stress incontinence. This condition can also be a side effect of pelvic surgery.\nSome women only suffer from stress incontinence during the week before they get their period. The NIDDK\nexplains that estrogen drops during this phase of the menstrual cycle, which can weaken the urethra. This is not common though.\nAmong men, prostate surgery is a common cause of stress incontinence. The prostate gland surrounds the male urethra, and its removal can result in the loss of support of the urethra.\nOther risk factors for stress incontinence include:\nsmoking due to chronic cough\nany other condition associated with chronic cough\nexcessive caffeine and alcohol use\nobesity\nconstipation\nlong-term participation in high-impact activities\nhormonal deficiencies"

    "output": "Treatment for stress incontinence varies according to the underlying cause of your problem. Your doctor will help you come up with a treatment plan using a combination of medications and lifestyle adjustments.\nBehavioral therapy\nYou can change your lifestyle and the way you live to reduce episodes of stress incontinence. If you\ufffdre obese, your doctor may advise you to lose weight. You might also try to avoid activities that cause leakage, such as jumping or jogging.\nNicotine can irritate your bladder and may contribute to incontinence. If you\ufffdre a smoker, you should quit. The constant cough seen in smokers also contributes to the problem. Also, consider avoiding caffeine and alcohol, because these substances are bladder irritants. You might want to cut back on your overall fluid intake to reduce bladder pressure.\nPelvic muscle training\nFor many women, pelvic muscle training can help treat stress incontinence. Kegel exercises make your sphincter and pelvic muscles stronger. To perform a Kegel, contract the muscles you use to stop a stream of urine. It can be helpful to practice doing Kegels while sitting on the toilet to help you learn which muscles to use. Once you have mastered the exercise, you can perform them anywhere and at any time.\nElectrical stimulation is another treatment, and it sends a mild electrical current through your pelvic floor muscles. The current makes your muscles contract, mimicking a Kegel exercise. You may be able to contract the muscles yourself after feeling exactly which muscles are contracting.\nMedication\nThere are currently no FDA-approved medications to treat stress incontinence. Both oral and topical estrogen supplements may help in women. Sometimes, pseudoephedrine is used with success. The FDA is evaluating Cymbalta, an antidepressant, which seems to show promise in treating stress incontinence.\nSurgery\nIf you have a severe case of stress incontinence, to the point that it interferes with your everyday life, your doctor may recommend surgery. Several types of procedures are available and include vaginal repairs and other procedures to lift the bladder and urethra. These surgeries are being perfected on an ongoing basis and a qualified surgeon can explain your many options.\nDuring the surgery, doctors will try to provide your urethra and bladder with more support. A sling procedure uses your own tissues to create a support structure for the urethra. The Mayo Clinic states that slings are used more often in women than in men.\nYour urologist, a doctor who specializes in the urinary tract, may also choose to inject collagen directly into the supportive tissues of your urethra. This strengthens the sphincter muscle by increasing pressure on the urethra. Collagen injections are the least invasive surgical procedure to treat stress incontinence."

They occur when the intestines push through a weak spot or tear in the lower abdominal wall, often in the inguinal canal.\nThe inguinal canal is found in your groin. In men, it\ufffds the area where the spermatic cord passes from the abdomen to the scrotum. This cord attaches to the testicles. In women, the inguinal canal contains a ligament (called the round ligament) that helps hold the uterus in place.\nInguinal hernias are more common in men because the testicles descend through the inguinal canal shortly after birth. The canal is supposed to close almost completely behind them. Sometimes the canal doesn\ufffdt close properly, leaving a weakened area. Learn more about inguinal hernias.\nHiatal hernia\nA hiatal hernia occurs when part of your stomach protrudes up through the diaphragm into your chest cavity. The diaphragm is a sheet of muscle that helps you breathe by contracting and drawing air into the lungs. It separates the organs in your abdomen from those in your chest.\nThis type of hernia is most common in people over 50 years old. If a child has the condition, it\ufffds typically caused by a congenital birth irregularity.\nHiatal hernias almost always cause gastroesophageal reflux input (GERD). In GERD, the stomach contents leak backward into the esophagus, causing a burning sensation. Get more information on hiatal hernias.\nUmbilical hernia\nUmbilical hernias can affect children and babies. They occur when the intestines bulge through the abdominal wall near the belly button. You may notice a bulge in or near your child\ufffds belly button, especially when they\ufffdre crying.\nAn umbilical hernia is the only kind that often goes away on its own as the abdominal wall muscles get stronger. This typically happens by the time the child is 1 or 2 years old\n. If the hernia hasn\ufffdt gone away by 5 years of age, surgery can be performed to correct it.\nAdults can also have umbilical hernias. They can occur from repeated strain on the abdomen due to conditions such as obesity, fluid in the abdomen (ascites), or pregnancy. Discover additional details about umbilical hernias.\nVentral hernia\nA ventral hernia happens when tissue bulges through an opening in the muscles of your abdomen. You may notice that a ventral hernia decreases in size when you\ufffdre lying down.\nAlthough a ventral hernia can be present from birth, it\ufffds more commonly acquired at some point during your lifetime. Common factors in ventral hernia formation include obesity, pregnancy, and strenuous activity.\nVentral hernias can also occur at the site of a surgical incision. This is called an incisional hernia and can result from surgical scarring or weakness of the abdominal muscles at the surgical site. Continue reading about ventral hernias."

Does your occupation involve heavy lifting? Do you exercise rigorously? Do you lift weights professionally or recreationally? Do you have a history of smoking?\nDo you have a personal or family history of hernias?\nHave you had any surgeries in your abdominal or groin area?\nYour doctor will also likely use imaging tests to aid in their diagnosis. These can include:\nAbdominal ultrasound. Abdominal ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the structures inside the body.\nAbdominal CT scan. Abdominal CT scan combines X-rays with computer technology to produce an image.\nAbdominal MRI scan. Abdominal MRI scan uses a combination of strong magnets and radio waves to create an image.\nIf your doctor suspects a hiatal hernia, they may use other tests that allow them to assess the inside of your stomach:\nX-rays of your digestive tract. A healthcare professional will have you drink a liquid containing diatrizoate meglumine/diatrizoate sodium (Gastrografin) or a liquid barium solution. These liquids help your digestive tract appear highlighted on X-ray images.\nEndoscopy.

For example, this can occur in the space where the esophagus is meant to pass through the diaphragm. In these cases, surgery can be performed to tighten the opening.\nHernias can be repaired with either open or laparoscopic surgery.\nDuring open surgery, the surgeon makes an incision close to the site of the hernia, and then pushes the bulging tissue back into the abdomen. They then sew the area shut, sometimes reinforcing it with surgical mesh. Finally, they close the incision.\nLaparoscopic surgery uses a tiny camera and miniaturized surgical equipment to repair the hernia. It only requires a few small incisions and is less damaging to the surrounding tissue.\nNot all hernias are suitable for laparoscopic surgery. If your hernia requires an open surgical repair, your surgeon will work with you to determine which technique is best for your condition. Find out more about inguinal hernia repair.\nRecovery from surgery\nAfter your surgery, you may experience pain around the surgical site.

    "output": "Triple-negative breast cancer is another rare input type. It affects only about 10 to 15 percent\nof people with breast cancer, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS).\nTo be diagnosed as triple-negative breast cancer, a tumor must have all three of the following characteristics:\nIt lacks estrogen receptors. These are receptors on the cells that bind, or attach, to the hormone estrogen. If a tumor has estrogen receptors, estrogen can stimulate the cancer to grow.\nIt lacks progesterone receptors. These receptors are cells that bind to the hormone progesterone. If a tumor has progesterone receptors, progesterone can stimulate the cancer to grow.\nIt doesn\ufffdt have additional human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) proteins on its surface. HER2 is a protein that fuels breast cancer growth.\nIf a tumor meets these three criteria, it\ufffds labeled triple-negative breast cancer. This type of breast cancer tends to grow and spread more quickly than other types of breast cancer.\nTriple-negative breast cancers are difficult to treat because hormonal therapy for breast cancer is not effective.\nLearn about treatments and survival rates for triple-negative breast cancer."

To stage breast cancer, doctors need to know:\nif the cancer is invasive or noninvasive\nhow large the tumor is\nwhether the lymph nodes are involved\nif the cancer has spread to nearby tissue or organs\nBreast cancer has five main stages: stages 0 to 4.\nStage 0 breast cancer\nStage 0 is DCIS. Cancer cells in DCIS remain confined to the ducts in the breast and have not spread into nearby tissue.\nStage 1 breast cancer\nStage 1A. The primary tumor is 2 centimeters (cm) wide or less. The lymph nodes are not affected.\nStage 1B. Cancer is found in nearby lymph nodes. Either there is no tumor in the breast, or the tumor is smaller than 2 cm.\nStage 2 breast cancer\nStage 2A.

They may also request one or more diagnostic tests to help understand what\ufffds causing your symptoms.\nTests that can help your doctor diagnose breast cancer include:\nMammogram. The most common way to see below the surface of your breast is with an imaging test called a mammogram. Many women ages 40 and older get annual mammograms to check for breast cancer. If your doctor suspects you may have a tumor or suspicious spot, they will also request a mammogram. If an atypical area is seen on your mammogram, your doctor may request additional tests.\nUltrasound. A breast ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of the tissues deep in your breast. An ultrasound can help your doctor distinguish between a solid mass, such as a tumor, and a benign cyst.\nYour doctor may also suggest tests such as an MRI or a breast biopsy.\nLearn about other tests that can be used to detect breast cancer.\nIf you don\ufffdt already have a primary care doctor, you can browse doctors in your area through the Healthline FindCare tool.\nBreast biopsy\nIf your doctor suspects breast cancer based on tests like a mammogram or an ultrasound, they may do a test called a breast biopsy.\nDuring this test, your doctor will remove a tissue sample from the suspicious area to have it tested.\nThere are several types of breast biopsies. With some of these tests, your doctor uses a needle to take the tissue sample. With others, they make an incision in your breast and then remove the sample.\nYour doctor will send the tissue sample to a laboratory. If the sample tests positive for cancer, the lab can test it further to tell your doctor what type of cancer you have.\nLearn more about breast biopsies, how to prepare for one, and what to expect."

Your cancer\ufffds grade describes how likely it is to grow and spread. After that, you can discuss your treatment options.\nSurgery is the most common treatment for breast cancer. Many people have additional treatments, such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, radiation, or hormone therapy.\nSurgery\nSeveral types of surgery may be used to remove breast cancer, including:\nLumpectomy. This procedure removes the tumor and some surrounding tissue, leaving the rest of the breast intact.\nMastectomy. In this procedure, a surgeon removes an entire breast. In a double mastectomy, they remove both breasts.\nSentinel node biopsy. This surgery removes a few of the lymph nodes that receive drainage from the tumor. These lymph nodes will be tested. If they don\ufffdt have cancer, you may not need additional surgery to remove more lymph nodes.\nAxillary lymph node dissection. If lymph nodes removed during a sentinel node biopsy contain cancer cells, your doctor may remove additional lymph nodes.\nContralateral prophylactic mastectomy. Even though breast cancer may be present in only one breast, some people elect to have a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. This surgery removes your healthy breast to lower your risk of developing breast cancer again.\nRadiation therapy\nWith radiation therapy, high-powered beams of radiation are used to target and kill cancer cells. Most radiation treatments use external beam radiation. This technique uses a large machine on the outside of the body.\nAdvances in cancer treatment have also enabled doctors to irradiate cancer from inside the body. According to Breastcancer.org, this type of radiation treatment is called brachytherapy.\nTo conduct brachytherapy, surgeons place radioactive seeds, or pellets, inside the body near the tumor site. The seeds stay there for a short period of time and work to destroy cancer cells.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a drug treatment used to destroy cancer cells. Some people may undergo chemotherapy on its own, but this type of treatment is often used along with other treatments, especially surgery.\nSome people will have surgery first followed by other treatments, such as chemo or radiation. This is called adjuvant therapy. Others may have chemotherapy first to shrink the cancer, called neoadjuvant therapy, then surgery.\nIn some cases, doctors prefer to give chemotherapy before surgery. The hope is that the treatment will shrink the tumor, and then the surgery will not need to be as invasive.\nChemotherapy has many unwanted side effects, so discuss your concerns with your doctor before starting treatment.\nHormone therapy\nIf your type of breast cancer is sensitive to hormones, your doctor may start you on hormone therapy. Estrogen and progesterone, two female hormones, can stimulate the growth of breast cancer tumors.\nHormone therapy works by blocking your body\ufffds production of these hormones or by blocking the hormone receptors on the cancer cells. This action can help slow and possibly stop the growth of your cancer.\nAdditional medications\nCertain treatments are designed to attack specific irregularities or mutations within cancer cells.\nFor example, Herceptin (trastuzumab) can block your body\ufffds production of the HER2 protein. HER2 helps breast cancer cells grow, so taking a medication to slow the production of this protein may help slow cancer growth.\nYour doctor will tell you more about any specific treatment they recommend for you.\nLearn more about breast cancer treatments, as well as how hormones affect cancer growth."

Maintaining a nutrient-dense diet and getting regular exercise as often as possible could help you lose weight and lower your risk.\nAccording to the American Association for Cancer Research, alcohol misuse also increases your risk. This can be having more than two drinks per day or binge-drinking.\nIf you drink alcohol, talk with your doctor about what amount they recommend for you.\nBreast cancer screening\nHaving regular mammograms may not prevent breast cancer, but it can help reduce the chance that it will go undetected.\nThe American College of Physicians (ACP) provides the following general recommendations for women at average risk of breast cancer:\nWomen ages 40 to 49. An annual mammogram isn\ufffdt recommended, but discuss your preferences with your doctor.\nWomen ages 50 to 74. A mammogram every other year is recommended.\nWomen 75 years and older.

This significantly raises your risk of breast cancer.\nIf you\ufffdre at risk for this mutation, talk with your doctor about your diagnostic and prophylactic treatment options. You may want to be tested to find out whether you have the mutation.\nAnd if you learn that you do have it, talk with your doctor about any preemptive steps you can take to reduce your risk of developing breast cancer. These steps could include a prophylactic mastectomy, or surgical removal of a breast. You may also consider chemoprophylaxis, or taking medication, such as Tamoxifen, to potentially reduce your breast cancer risk.\nIn addition to mammograms, breast exams are another way to watch for signs of breast cancer.\nSelf-exams\nMany people do a breast self-examination. It\ufffds best to do this exam once per month, at the same time each month.

It commonly occurs\nin men under 50 and women ages 50 to 70.\nPeople who develop diverticula at a younger age\nmay be more likely to experience diverticulitis. Younger people are also more likely\nto be admitted to a hospital if they have diverticulitis than older people.\nAccording to a review of research\npublished in 2018, other potential risk factors for diverticulitis include:\nFamily history\nStudies have found that genetics play a role in diverticular input, with some reports estimating that roughly 40 to 50 percent\nof the potential risk of diverticular input is hereditary.\nLow levels of vitamin D\nSome studies\nsuggest that people with higher levels of vitamin D might have a lower risk of getting diverticulitis. More research is needed to understand the potential link between vitamin D and diverticula.\nObesity\nSeveral studies\nhave found that people with higher body mass index (BMI) and larger waists are at increased risk of diverticulitis.\nIt\ufffds possible that obesity raises the risk of diverticulitis by changing the balance of bacteria in your gut, but more research is needed to understand the role this plays.\nPhysical inactivity\nSome studies\nhave found that physically active people are less likely than inactive people to develop diverticulitis. However, this link still needs more research.\nUsing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or smoking\nRegular use of aspirin, ibuprofen, or other NSAIDs may raise your risk of diverticulitis.\nPeople who smoke are also more likely than nonsmokers to develop diverticular input, including diverticulitis.\nAccording to a 2017 review of research\n, there\ufffds no strong evidence that drinking alcohol raises your risk of this input.\nIf you drink alcohol, your doctor will likely encourage you to drink in moderation only. Although alcohol consumption might not cause diverticulitis, drinking too much can raise your risk of many other health problems."

Normally, RBCs are shaped like discs, which gives them the flexibility to travel through even the smallest blood vessels. However, with this input, the RBCs have an abnormal crescent shape resembling a sickle. This makes them sticky and rigid and prone to getting trapped in small vessels, which blocks blood from reaching different parts of the body. This can cause pain and tissue damage.\nSCD is an autosomal recessive condition. You need two copies of the gene to have the input.

    "output": "Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. It normally has two alpha chains and two beta chains. The four main types of sickle cell anemia are caused by different mutations in these genes.\nHemoglobin SS input\nHemoglobin SS input is the most common type of sickle cell input. It occurs when you inherit copies of the hemoglobin S gene from both parents. This forms hemoglobin known as Hb SS. As the most severe form of SCD, individuals with this form also experience the worst symptoms at a higher rate.\nHemoglobin SC input\nHemoglobin SC input is the second most common type of sickle cell input. It occurs when you inherit the Hb C gene from one parent and the Hb S gene from the other. Individuals with Hb SC have similar symptoms to individuals with Hb SS. However, the anemia is less severe.\nHemoglobin SB+ (beta) thalassemia\nHemoglobin SB+ (beta) thalassemia affects beta globin gene production. The size of the red blood cell is reduced because less beta protein is made. If inherited with the Hb S gene, you will have hemoglobin S beta thalassemia. Symptoms are not as severe.\nHemoglobin SB 0 (Beta-zero) thalassemia\nSickle beta-zero thalassemia is the fourth type of sickle cell input. It also involves the beta globin gene. It has similar symptoms to Hb SS anemia. However, sometimes the symptoms of beta zero thalassemia are more severe. It is associated with a poorer prognosis.\nHemoglobin SD, hemoglobin SE, and hemoglobin SO\nThese types of sickle cell input are more rare and usually don\ufffdt have severe symptoms.\nSickle cell trait\nPeople who only inherit a mutated gene (hemoglobin S) from one parent are said to have sickle cell trait.

    "output": "SCD can cause severe complications, which appear when the sickle cells block vessels in different areas of the body. Painful or damaging blockages are called sickle cell crises. They can be caused by a variety of circumstances, including:\nillness\nchanges in temperature\nstress\npoor hydration\naltitude\nThe following are types of complications that can result from sickle cell anemia.\nSevere anemia\nAnemia is a shortage of RBCs. Sickle cells are easily broken. This breaking apart of RBCs is called chronic hemolysis. RBCs generally live for about 120 days. Sickle cells live for a maximum of 10 to 20 days.\nHand-foot syndrome\nHand-foot syndrome occurs when sickle-shaped RBCs block blood vessels in the hands or feet. This causes the hands and feet to swell. It can also cause leg ulcers. Swollen hands and feet are often the first sign of sickle cell anemia in babies.\nSplenic sequestration\nSplenic sequestration is a blockage of the splenic vessels by sickle cells. It causes a sudden, painful enlargement of the spleen. The spleen may have to be removed due to complications of sickle cell input in an operation known as a splenectomy. Some sickle cell patients will sustain enough damage to their spleen that it becomes shrunken and ceases to function at all. This is called autosplenectomy. Patients without a spleen are at higher risk for infections from bacteria such as Streptococcus, Haemophilus, and Salmonella species.\nDelayed growth\nDelayed growth often occurs in people with SCD. Children are generally shorter but regain their height by adulthood. Sexual maturation may also be delayed. This happens because sickle cell RBCs can\ufffdt supply enough oxygen and nutrients.\nNeurological complications\nSeizures, strokes, or even coma can result from sickle cell input. They are caused by brain blockages. Immediate treatment should be sought.\nEye problems\nBlindness is caused by blockages in the vessels supplying the eyes. This can damage the retina.\nSkin ulcers\nSkin ulcers in the legs can occur if small vessels there are blocked.\nHeart input and chest syndrome\nSince SCD interferes with blood oxygen supply, it can also cause heart problems which can lead to heart attacks, heart failure, and abnormal heart rhythms.\nLung input\nDamage to the lungs over time related to decreased blood flow can result in high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension) and scarring of the lungs (pulmonary fibrosis). These problems can occur sooner in patients who have sickle chest syndrome. Lung damage makes it more difficult for the lungs to transfer oxygen into the blood, which can result in more frequent sickle cell crises.\nPriapism\nPriapism is a lingering, painful erection that can be seen in some men with sickle cell input. This happens when the blood vessels in the penis are blocked. It can lead to impotence if left untreated.\nGallstones\nGallstones are one complication not caused by a vessel blockage. Instead, they are caused by the breakdown of RBCs. A byproduct of this breakdown is bilirubin. High levels of bilirubin can lead to gallstones. These are also called pigment stones.\nSickle chest syndrome\nSickle chest syndrome is a severe type of sickle cell crisis. It causes severe chest pain and is associated with symptoms such as cough, fever, sputum production, shortness of breath, and low blood oxygen levels. Abnormalities observed on chest X-rays can represent either pneumonia or death of lung tissue (pulmonary infarction). The long-term prognosis for patients who have had sickle chest syndrome is worse than for those who have not had it."

You may also benefit from influenza vaccination and pneumovax. Talk to your doctor about getting these.\nPractice good hygiene:\nWash your hands frequently, especially after you\ufffdve been in a public place.\nAlways sneeze into the arm of your shirt or in a tissue. Although this may not ease your own symptoms, it will prevent you from spreading infectious inputs.\nAvoid touching your face, especially your eyes and mouth, to prevent introducing germs into your system.\nWas this helpful?\nYou should also avoid smoking and make sure you include plenty of vitamins in your diet, such as vitamin C, which helps boost your immune system. Vitamin C is maintained in immune cells, and a deficiency has been linked to higher susceptibility to infection. While research is unclear if Vitamin C can prevent an acute respiratory infection, there is evidence that it can shorten the length of time and or severity of some infections."

Your doctor may also check for any swelling of the liver and any yellow discoloration in your eyes or skin.\nIf you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here.\nLiver function tests\nLiver function tests use blood samples to determine how efficiently your liver works.\nAbnormal results of these tests may be the first indication that there is a problem, especially if you don\ufffdt show any signs on a physical exam of liver input. High liver enzyme levels may indicate that your liver is stressed, damaged, or not functioning correctly.\nOther blood tests\nIf your liver function tests are abnormal, your doctor will likely order other blood tests to detect the source of the problem.\nThese tests can determine\nif you have infectious hepatitis by checking for the presence of hepatitis viruses or antibodies your body produces to combat them.\nDoctors may also use blood tests to check for any signs of autoimmune hepatitis.\nLiver biopsy\nWhen diagnosing hepatitis, doctors will also assess your liver for potential damage\n. A liver biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a sample of tissue from your liver.\nA medical professional may take this sample through your skin with a needle, meaning there is no need for surgery. They will typically use an ultrasound scan for guidance during this procedure.\nThis test allows your doctor to determine how infection or inflammation has affected your liver.\nUltrasound\nAn abdominal ultrasound uses ultrasound waves to create an image of the organs within your abdomen. This test allows your doctor to take a close look at your liver and nearby organs. It can reveal:\nfluid in your abdomen\nliver damage or enlargement\nliver tumors\nabnormalities of your gallbladder\nSometimes the pancreas shows up on ultrasound images as well.

If you\ufffdve had low blood sugar episodes in the past, you may want to check your blood sugar levels before driving or operating machinery.\nA doctor can advise you on how often to check your blood sugar.\nSnack wisely\nConsider having a snack before you leave your home if you know it will be more than 5 hours until your next full meal or if your blood sugar levels are lower than 100 mg/dL.\nIt\ufffds a good idea to keep carbohydrate-rich snacks on hand at all times in case your blood sugar dips while you\ufffdre out.\nFuel your body during exercise\nExercise uses up energy, so it can quickly cause your blood sugar to drop if you haven\ufffdt eaten enough beforehand. Check your blood sugar 1\ufffd2 hours before exercising to make sure it\ufffds within your target range.\nIf it\ufffds too low, eat a small meal or carbohydrate-rich snack.\nIf you plan to exercise for an hour or longer, consume additional carbohydrates during your workout. Exercise gels, sports drinks, granola bars, and even candy bars can provide your body with a quick burst of glucose during exercise.\nHealthcare professionals can come up with the right program for you.\nYour blood sugar may drop for up to 24 hours after moderate to intense exercise. Doctors recommend checking your blood sugar level immediately after exercise and then every 2\ufffd4 hours until you go to sleep.

Any advice?\n\ufffd From our Facebook community\nA:\nIt sounds like you may be experiencing something called reactive hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar after eating a meal, which is most likely due to a change in diet.\nTo manage this problem, I recommend consistent and frequent meals and snacks every 3\ufffd4 hours that are a mix of high fiber carbohydrates, fat, and protein.\nEating high fiber carbohydrates is important because they provide the sugar the body needs, but they are also what causes the body to release insulin.\nMake sure to add some protein or fat to all of your meals and snacks. Protein and fat can help slow the digestion of carbohydrates, which helps manage the release of insulin and allows for the slow and steady digestion of carbs.\nBe sure to discuss any changes to your diet with your primary care physician.\n\ufffd Peggy Pletcher, MS, RD, LD, CDCES\noutputs represent the opinions of our medical experts.

However, current guidelines don\ufffdt recommend these as standalone treatments.\nIn 2018, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\napproved the use of tofacitinib (Xeljanz) as a treatment for UC. Initially used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, this medication targets cells responsible for inflammation. It\ufffds the first oral medication approved for the long-term treatment of UC.\nHospitalization\nIf your symptoms are severe, you\ufffdll need to be hospitalized to correct the effects of dehydration and loss of electrolytes that diarrhea causes. You may also need to replace blood and to treat any other complications.\nResearchers continue to look for new treatments each year. Learn more about the newest UC treatments.\nUlcerative colitis surgery\nSurgery is necessary if you experience:\nsubstantial blood loss\nchronic and debilitating symptoms\nperforation of your colon\na severe blockage\nA CT scan or colonoscopy can detect these serious problems.\nSurgery typically involves removing your entire colon and rectum as well as creating a new pathway for waste. This pathway can be out through a small opening in your abdominal wall.\nTo redirect waste through your abdominal wall, the surgeon will make a small opening in the wall. The tip of your lower small intestine, or the ileum, is then brought to the skin\ufffds surface. Waste will drain through the opening into a bag.\nIn other types of surgery, the surgeon removes the inputd part of your colon and rectum but retains the outer muscles of your rectum. The surgeon then attaches your small intestine to the rectum to form a small pouch. After this surgery, you\ufffdre able to pass stool through your rectum. Bowel movements will be more frequent and watery than normal.\nIn certain procedures, the anus is also removed. Read more about each of the surgical options and their long-term effects."

    "output": "Some of the medications prescribed to treat UC can have serious side effects. When traditional treatments are not well tolerated, some people turn to natural remedies to manage UC.\nNatural remedies that may help relieve UC symptoms include:\nBoswellia. This herb is found in the resin underneath Boswellia serrata tree bark. Research suggests it stops some of the chemical reactions in the body that can cause inflammation.\nBromelain. This enzyme mixture is found naturally in pineapples, but it\ufffds also sold as a supplement. It may help ease symptoms of UC and reduce flares.\nProbiotics. Your intestines and stomach are home to billions of bacteria. When the bacteria are healthy, your body is better able to ward off inflammation and symptoms of UC. Eating foods with probiotics or taking probiotic supplements can help boost the health of the microbial flora in your gut.\nPsyllium. This fiber supplement can help keep bowel movements regular. This may alleviate symptoms, prevent constipation, and make eliminating waste easier. However, many people with IBD can experience worsening abdominal cramping, gas, and bloating when they consume fiber during a flare-up.\nTurmeric. This golden yellow spice is chock-full of curcumin, an antioxidant that\ufffds been shown to reduce inflammation.\nKeep in mind that these natural remedies have not undergone clinical trials and are not necessarily endorsed by professional organizations or their clinical guidelines.\nMany of these natural remedies can be used in conjunction with other UC treatments.

However, a few general rules may be useful for people trying to avoid a flare-up:\nEat a low fat diet. It\ufffds not clear why a low fat diet is beneficial, but it\ufffds known that foods high in fat commonly cause diarrhea, especially in people with IBD. Eating more low fat foods may delay flare-ups. When you do eat fat, pick healthier options like olive oil and omega-3 fatty acids.\nTake in more vitamin C. This vitamin may have a protective effect on your intestines and help them heal or recover faster after a flare-up. People who eat diets rich in vitamin C have prolonged periods of UC remission. Vitamin C-rich foods include parsley, bell peppers, spinach, and berries.\nEat more fiber. During a flare-up, bulky, slow-moving fiber is the last thing you want in your intestines. During remission, however, fiber can help you stay regular. It may also improve how easily you can eliminate waste products during bowel movements.\nMaking a food diary\nCreating a food diary is a smart way to begin to understand which foods affect you. For several weeks, closely track what you eat and how you feel in the hours after. Record details of bowel movements or any symptoms you might experience.\nIn that span of time, you can likely detect trends between discomfort or stomach pain and certain problematic foods. Try removing those foods from your diet to see if your symptoms improve.\nYou may be able to manage mild symptoms of UC by avoiding foods that upset your GI tract.

Both conditions are thought to be the result of an overactive immune system.\nThey also share many symptoms, including:\ncramps\nabdominal pain\ndiarrhea\nfatigue\nHowever, UC and Crohn\ufffds input do have distinct differences. Understanding the key differences between them can help you obtain a proper diagnosis.\nLocation\nThese two conditions affect different portions of the GI tract.\nCrohn\ufffds input may affect any part of the GI tract, from the mouth to the anus. It\ufffds most often found in the small intestine. UC only affects the large intestine (colon) and rectum.\nResponse to treatment\nSimilar medications are prescribed to treat both conditions. Surgery is also a treatment option. It\ufffds a last resort for both conditions, but it can be a cure for UC, whereas it\ufffds only a temporary therapy for Crohn\ufffds.\nWhat\ufffds the difference between ulcerative colitis and colitis?\nColitis refers to inflammation of the inner lining of the colon. Colitis causes symptoms such as abdominal pain and cramping, bloating, and diarrhea.\nAn inflamed colon can be caused by several conditions. UC is one possible cause. Other possible causes of colitis include:\ninfection\nreaction to certain medications\nCrohn\ufffds input\nan allergic reaction\nTo diagnose the cause of colitis, a doctor will order a series of tests. These tests will help them understand what other symptoms you\ufffdre experience and rule out conditions based on what you\ufffdre not experiencing.\nTreatment for colitis will depend on the underlying cause and other symptoms you have.\nIs ulcerative colitis curable?\nCurrently, there\ufffds no nonsurgical cure for UC. Treatments for the inflammatory input aim to extend periods of remission and make flare-ups less severe.\nFor people with severe UC, curative surgery is a treatment option. Removing the entire large intestine (as in a total colectomy) will end the symptoms of UC.\nThis procedure requires your doctor to create a pouch on the outside of your body where waste can empty. This pouch can become inflamed and cause side effects.\nFor that reason, some people choose to have only a partial colectomy. In this surgery, your doctor only removes the parts of the colon that are affected by UC.\nWhile these surgeries can help ease or end symptoms of UC, they can have adverse effects and possible long-term complications. Read more about these issues to determine if surgery is an option for you.\nIs ulcerative colitis contagious?\nUC is not contagious.\nSome causes of colitis or inflammation in the colon can be contagious, though. That includes inflammation caused by bacteria and viruses.\nHowever, UC is not caused by anything that can be transmitted to another person."

You may believe that the world would be better off without you.\nPassive doesn\ufffdt mean harmless. This train of thought has the potential to make you more likely to put yourself in harm\ufffds way.\nEven if passive suicidal ideation appears to be fleeting, the risk of a suicide attempt is very real. The line between passive and active suicidal ideation is blurry. The transition from one to the other can happen slowly or suddenly, and it\ufffds not always obvious to the casual observer.\nWhile someone might admit to wishing to die, they may deny making plans to do so. Warning signs that suicidal ideation has become active include giving away possessions, getting affairs in order, and saying goodbye to loved ones.\nNo one could ever predict with 100 percent certainty if someone will or will not take their own life. Even trained medical professionals can\ufffdt predict who will commit suicide. This is why you need to take threats or thoughts of suicide seriously.\nAn underlying condition such as substance abuse, major depression, or other mood disorders may lead to a preoccupation with dying. Added stressors such as the death of a loved one, divorce, or a job loss can trigger thoughts of hopelessness or worthlessness.\nYou shouldn\ufffdt take passive suicidal ideation lightly. It\ufffds impossible to predict who\ufffds likely to act on these thoughts. That\ufffds why anyone who expresses passive suicidal ideation should be considered at risk for suicide.\nSee your doctor or psychiatrist for a careful evaluation and to get appropriate treatment."

NHL forms in either the B cells or T cells of the immune system.\nAccording to the ACS, most NHL types affect B cells\n. Types include:\nB-cell lymphoma\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most aggressive type of NHL. This fast-growing lymphoma comes from abnormal B cells in the blood. It can be cured if treated, but if left untreated, it can lead to death. The stage of DLBCL helps determine your prognosis.\nT-cell lymphoma\nT-cell lymphoma is not as common as B-cell lymphoma; only 15 percent\nof all NHL cases are this type. Several types of T-cell lymphoma exist.\nBurkitt\ufffds lymphoma\nBurkitt\ufffds lymphoma is a rare type of NHL that is aggressive and most common in people with compromised immune systems. This type of lymphoma is most common in children in sub-Saharan Africa, but it does occur in other parts of the world.\nFollicular lymphoma\nAbout 1 in 5\nlymphomas diagnosed in the United States are follicular lymphoma. This type of NHL, which starts in the white blood cells, is most common in older individuals. The average age of diagnosis is 60. This lymphoma is also slow-growing, so treatments begin with watchful waiting.\nMantle cell lymphoma\nThis aggressive form of lymphoma is rare \ufffd only about 6 percent of NHL cases are this type. Mantle cell lymphoma is also more commonly diagnosed at a later stage, and it usually occurs in or involves the gastrointestinal tract or bone marrow.\nPrimary mediastinal B cell lymphoma\nThis subtype of B-cell lymphoma accounts for almost 10 percent of DLBCL cases. It predominantly affects women in their 20s and 30s.\nSmall lymphocytic lymphoma\nSmall lymphatic lymphoma (SLL) is a type of slow-growing lymphoma. The cancer cells of SLL are found mostly in the lymph nodes. SLL is identical to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but with CLL, the majority of cancer cells are found in the blood and bone marrow.\nWaldenstrom macroglobulinemia (lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma)\nLymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) is a rare type of cancer that accounts for just about 2 percent\nof all lymphomas.

These blows to the head lead to nerve damage in the brain. It\ufffds usually found in boxers, football players, or members of the military who have been injured in explosions.\nGlycine encephalopathy\nGlycine encephalopathy is a genetic, or inherited, condition in which there are abnormally high levels of glycine (an amino acid) in the brain. Symptoms of glycine encephalopathy usually appear in infants soon after birth.\nHashimoto\ufffds encephalopathy\nThis is a rare type of encephalopathy that\ufffds linked to an autoimmune condition known as Hashimoto\ufffds thyroiditis. In Hashimoto\ufffds thyroiditis, your immune system mistakenly attacks your thyroid gland. Your thyroid gland is responsible for producing many of your body\ufffds regulating hormones. Scientists don\ufffdt yet know exactly how the two conditions are linked.\nHepatic encephalopathy\nHepatic encephalopathy is a result of liver input. When your liver isn\ufffdt functioning properly, the toxins that your liver usually removes from your body are instead allowed to build up in your blood, and can eventually reach your brain.\nHypertensive encephalopathy\nHypertensive encephalopathy is a result of severely high blood pressure that goes untreated for too long. This can cause your brain to swell, leading to brain damage and hypertensive encephalopathy.\nHypoxic ischemic encephalopathy\nThis condition is a type of brain damage that is caused when the brain doesn\ufffdt get enough oxygen. This can result in permanent brain damage or dysfunction. It can be caused by a lack of oxygen to the brain, such as when a developing baby is exposed to alcohol in the womb.\nToxic-metabolic encephalopathy\nToxic-metabolic encephalopathy is a result of infections, toxins, or organ failure. When the electrolytes, hormones, or other chemicals in the body are off their normal balance, they can impact the brain\ufffds function. This can also include the presence of an infection in the body or presence of toxic chemicals. The encephalopathy usually resolves when the underlying chemical imbalance is restored or offending infection/toxin removed.\nInfectious encephalopathies\nTransmissible spongiform encephalopathies are also known as prion inputs. Prions are proteins that occur naturally in the body, but they can mutate and cause inputs that gradually damage and deteriorate your brain (neurodegenerative inputs). Prion inputs include:\nchronic wasting input\nfatal familial insomnia\nkuru\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob input\nUremic encephalopathy\nUremic encephalopathy is a result of kidney failure. It is believed to be caused by the buildup of uremic toxins in the blood. This condition can cause mild confusion to deep coma.\nWernicke encephalopathy\nAlso known as Wernicke\ufffds input, this condition is a result of vitamin B-1 deficiency. Long-term alcoholism, poor nutritional intake, and poor food absorption can cause a vitamin B-1 deficiency. If Wernicke encephalopathy isn\ufffdt treated quickly, it can lead to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome."

The left and right sides of the heart are separated by a wall of muscle called the septum.\nThe upper (atria) and lower (ventricles) chambers are connected. Openings called valves regulate blood flow in and out of the heart and between the chambers. The valves can be thought of like water faucets. They either open up and allow blood to flow freely, or close and stop the flow entirely.\nYour tricuspid valve is the valve that separates your right atrium and right ventricle. Tricuspid regurgitation occurs when this valve doesn\ufffdt properly close. This can cause blood to flow back up into the right atrium when the right ventricle contracts. Over time, this condition can weaken your heart.\nTricuspid regurgitation is also known as tricuspid valve insufficiency."

This includes your:\narms and hands\nlegs and feet\nface and mouth\ninternal organs\nThe job of these nerves is to deliver signals about physical sensations back to your brain. They also make sure your body\ufffds internal functions, like blood circulation and food digestion, work as they should.\nPeripheral neuropathy can be caused by:\ninjury\nsystemic illness\ninfection\nhormonal imbalance\ncertain medications\nvitamin deficiency\nan inherited disorder\nThe causes are therefore vast, as are the types of the condition. More than 100\ndifferent types of peripheral neuropathy exist. Each type has unique symptoms and specific treatment options.\nMedical researchers also classify peripheral neuropathies further classified by the type of nerve damage involved. Mononeuropathy occurs when only one nerve is damaged. Polyneuropathies, which are more common, happen when multiple nerves are damaged.\nThe disorder is uncomfortable, but treatments can be very helpful. The most important thing to determine is whether the neuropathy is the result of a serious underlying condition."

The three groups are:\nMotor. These nerves are responsible for muscle movement, like walking, talking, or using your hands or arms.\nSensory. These are responsible for sensory information, like hot or cold, pain, or touch.\nAutonomic. These are responsible for body processes you don\ufffdt see, like breathing, heartbeat, and digestion.\nPeripheral neuropathy can affect one nerve group, two groups, or all three. Sometimes it will affect one nerve only, and that\ufffds called mononeuropathy.\nThe symptoms of peripheral neuropathy depend on the kind of neuropathy.\nMotor neuropathy symptoms include:\nmuscle cramps\ntwitching\nmuscle weakness\nfoot drop\nmuscle wasting\nparalysis\nSensory neuropathy symptoms include:\nprickling and tingling sensation, or \ufffdpins and needles\ufffd\nnumbness\nreduced sensations of pain or hot and cold\nincreased pain from things that shouldn\ufffdt cause pain, like light touch\nburning or sharp pain\nloss of balance or coordination\nAutonomic neuropathy symptoms include:\nconstipation or diarrhea\nbloating, belching, or feeling of sickness\nfaint or dizziness upon standing from low blood pressure\nrapid heart rate\nsweating too much or too little\nproblems with sexual function\nloss of bowel control\ndifficulty emptying bladder completely\nSymptoms can cause challenges in daily life, like trouble walking or sleeping because of pain in the feet and legs.\nThese symptoms can also indicate other conditions.

In most cases, doctors can connect the condition to one or more causes.\nGeneralized inputs\nNerve damage caused by diabetes is one of the most common forms of neuropathy. This leads to numbness, pain, and a loss of sensation in the extremities.\nThe American Diabetes Association recommends taking these steps to delay or prevent nerve damage:\nMonitor your blood sugar level to keep it in target range and to assess whether your diabetes care plan is on track.\nInspect your feet for signs of injury, infection, or hot spots.\nReport signs of neuropathy to your doctor and get early treatment.\nProtect your feet with special shoes and take care when washing and exercising.\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, 60 to 70 percent\nof people with diabetes have some sort of nerve damage.\nOther chronic inputs that may cause nerve damage include:\nautoimmune inputs like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis\nkidney or liver disorders\nvascular and blood disorders\nInjury\nPhysical trauma is a common cause of injury to the nerves. This can include car accidents, falls, or fractures. Inactivity, or holding still too long in one position, can also cause neuropathy.\nIncreased pressure on the median nerve, a nerve in the wrist that supplies feeling and movement to the hand, causes carpal tunnel syndrome. This is a common type\nof peripheral neuropathy.\nAlcohol and toxins\nAlcohol can have a toxic effect on nerve tissue, putting people with severe alcohol use disorder at a higher risk of peripheral neuropathy.\nExposure to toxic chemicals like glue, solvents, or insecticides, either through chemical abuse or in the workplace, can also cause nerve damage. Additionally, exposure to heavy metals such as lead and mercury can also cause this condition.\nInfections and autoimmune disorders\nCertain viruses and bacteria directly attack nerve tissue.\nViruses such as herpes simplex, varicella-zoster virus (which causes chickenpox and shingles), and Epstein-Barr virus damage sensory nerves and cause intense episodes of shooting pain.\nBacterial infections such as Lyme input can also cause nerve damage and pain if they aren\ufffdt treated. People with HIV or AIDS can also develop peripheral neuropathy.\nAutoimmune inputs like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus affect the peripheral nervous system in various ways. Chronic inflammation and damage to tissues throughout the body, as well as pressure caused by inflammation, can all lead to severe nerve pain in the extremities.\nMedications\nCertain medications may also cause nerve damage. These include:\nanticonvulsants, which people take to treat seizures\ndrugs to fight bacterial infections\nsome blood pressure medications\nmedications used to treat cancer\nA 2020 study found that although there\ufffds no direct evidence that statins, a class of drugs used to lower cholesterol and prevent cardiovascular input, cause neuropathy, statins may increase the risk of neuropathy from other causes."

If a vitamin deficiency is causing the problem, then correcting the deficiency is the treatment.\nMany treatments can bring relief and help you return to your regular activities. Sometimes a combination of treatments works best.\nPain medications\nOver-the-counter (OTC) oral pain medications like acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, can be very helpful in controlling moderate pain.\nIf you take them in excess, these drugs can affect your liver or stomach function. It\ufffds important to avoid using them for an extended period, especially if you drink alcohol regularly.\nThe Foundation for Peripheral Neuropathy includes a list of additional topical OTC medications you may consider trying. They include:\nAbsorbine Jr. This is a blend of menthol and other herbal ingredients that can soothe muscle pain. Other menthol-based creams may also help. They include Flex-All, Flexgen, Tiger Balm, or Vicks VapoRub.\nCapsaicin cream. This cream contains chili pepper oils, which create a heating effect that helps relieve pain for some people. There are brands and formulations.\nNeuragen PN. Made from botanical oils, this cream is meant specifically for nerve pain on hands and feet.\nSore No More. This is another botanical anesthetic that may provide some relieve for neuropathic discomfort.\nPrescription medication\nMany prescription pain medications can also help to control the pain of this condition. These include narcotics, some antiepileptic medications, and some antidepressants. Other helpful prescription medications include:\nlidocaine in a patch on the affected area\npregabalin (an anti-epileptic medication)\nduloxetine (an antidepressant)\nsteroids\nanesthetics\nPrescription drugs for sexual dysfunction in men due to nerve damage include phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5Is) like:\nsildenafil\nvardenafil\ntadalafil\navanafil\nMedical treatments\nYour doctor can use several medical treatments to control the symptoms of this condition. Plasmapheresis is a blood transfusion that removes potentially irritating antibodies from your bloodstream.\nIf you get a nerve block, your doctor will inject an anesthetic directly into your nerves.\nTranscutaneous electronic nerve stimulation (TENS)\nTranscutaneous electronic nerve stimulation (TENS) doesn\ufffdt work for everyone, but many people like it because it\ufffds a drug-free therapy.\nDuring TENS, electrodes placed on the skin send small amounts of electricity into the skin. The goal of this treatment is to disrupt nerves from transmitting pain signals to the brain.\nErgonomic casts or splints\nErgonomic casts or splints can help you if your neuropathy affects your muscles. Splints can help with:\nmuscle weakness\nstability\nThese casts provide support for the part of your body that\ufffds uncomfortable. This can relieve pain. For example, a cast or splint that holds your wrists in a proper position while you sleep can relieve the discomfort of carpal tunnel syndrome.\nSelf-care\nIn addition to OTC pain relievers, many people have found relief for peripheral neuropathy through:\nhaving a foot bath with chamomile or nettle leaves for at least 30 minutes\nusing a heating pad or electric socks\napplying an ice pack to affected areas for 10 minutes twice daily in the morning and the evening\ntrying acupuncture\nundergoing biofeedback\ntrying different types of holistic therapy such as reflexology, tai chi, or reiki\nmassaging affected areas to promote circulation\navoiding pressure on the affected area, like not crossing legs or leaning on elbows\nseeking social support and activities with others\nsetting priorities daily and not doing more than you feel you are capable of\navoiding caffeine and developing a regular bedtime routine to promote sleep\nModerate, regular exercise can also help lessen discomfort.\nIf you drink alcohol or smoke, consider cutting back or stopping. Both alcohol and tobacco aggravate nerve pain and can cause nerve damage when used for long periods.\nTake precautions at home\nIf you have peripheral neuropathy, you\ufffdre potentially at greater risk for accidents in the home. You can do the following to improve your safety:\nUse safety guards and other tools for sharp objects like scissors and knives.\nUse thermometers to measure the temperature of bath or tap water.\nUse potholders and gloves when handling hot items.\nUse a walker or cane for added stability.\nInstall nightlights to avoid tripping in the dark.\nCarefully wrap your hands and feet when it\ufffds cold out."

Congenital glaucoma can run in families.\nSecondary Glaucoma\nSecondary glaucoma is often a side effect of injury or another eye condition, such as cataracts or eye tumors. Medicines, such as corticosteroids, may also cause this type of glaucoma. Rarely, eye surgery can cause secondary glaucoma.\nNormal Tension Glaucoma\nIn some cases, people without increased eye pressure develop damage to their optic nerve. The cause of this isn\ufffdt known. However, extreme sensitivity or a lack of blood flow to your optic nerve may be a factor in this type of glaucoma."

If you\ufffdre African-American, your increase in risk begins at age 40.\nEthnicity\nAfrican-Americans or people of African descent are significantly more likely to develop glaucoma than Caucasians. People of Asian descent are at a higher risk of angle-closure glaucoma, and people of Japanese descent have a higher risk of developing low-tension glaucoma.\nEye Problems\nChronic eye inflammation and thin corneas can lead to increased pressure in your eyes. Physical injury or trauma to your eye, such as being hit in your eye, can also cause your eye pressure to increase.\nFamily History\nSome types of glaucoma may run in families. If your parent or grandparent had open-angle glaucoma, you\ufffdre at an increased risk of developing the condition.\nMedical History\nPeople with diabetes and those with high blood pressure and heart input have an increased risk of developing glaucoma.\nUse of Certain Medicine\nUsing corticosteroids for extended periods may increase your risk of developing secondary glaucoma."

This type of glaucoma is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment to reduce eye pressure as quickly as possible. Medicines are usually attempted first, to reverse the angle closure, but this may be unsuccessful. A laser procedure called laser peripheral iridotomy may also be performed.

Since colon cancer often has no symptoms during the early stages, it is often caught during routine screenings.\nThe US Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) and the ACS\nnow recommend colon cancer screening starting at 45, in light of younger people getting diagnosed with colon cancer.\nThe American College of Gastroenterology recommends that people start colon cancer screening at 40 years old.\nYour doctor will start by getting information about your medical and family history. They\ufffdll also perform a physical exam. They may press on your abdomen or perform a rectal exam to determine whether lumps or polyps are present.\nFecal testing\nThe ACS\nrecommends yearly fecal testing. Fecal tests are used to detect hidden blood in your stool. There are two main types, the guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) and the fecal immunochemical test (FIT).\nGuaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT)\nGuaiac is a plant-based substance used to coat a special card that your stool sample is placed upon. If any blood is present in your stool, the card will change color.\nYou\ufffdll have to avoid certain foods and medications, such as red meat and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), before this test. They may interfere with your test results.\nFecal immunochemical test (FIT)\nThe FIT detects hemoglobin, a protein found in the blood. It\ufffds considered more precise than the guaiac-based test.\nThat\ufffds because the FIT is unlikely to detect bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract (a type of bleeding that is rarely caused by colorectal cancer). Additionally, the results of this test aren\ufffdt affected by foods and medications.\nAt-home tests\nBecause multiple stool samples are needed for these tests, your doctor will likely provide you with test kits to use at home.\nYou can also buy at-home test kits from companies such as LetsGetChecked and Everlywell.\nThese kits often require you to send a stool sample off to a lab for evaluation. Your test results should be available online within 5 business days. Afterward, you\ufffdll have the option to consult with a medical care team about your test results.\nThe Second Generation FIT can also be purchased online, but the stool sample doesn\ufffdt have to be sent to a lab. Test results are available within 5 minutes. This test is accurate, FDA-approved, and able to detect additional conditions such as colitis. However, there\ufffds no medical care team to consult with if you have instructions about your results.\nBlood tests\nYour doctor may run blood tests to get a better idea of what\ufffds causing your symptoms. Liver function tests and complete blood counts can rule out other inputs and disorders.\nSigmoidoscopy\nMinimally invasive, sigmoidoscopy allows your doctor to examine your sigmoid colon, the last section of your colon, for abnormalities. The procedure, also known as flexible sigmoidoscopy, involves a flexible tube with a light on it.\nThe USPSTF recommends a flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, or every 10 years along with a yearly FIT test.\nThe ACS\nrecommends a flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years.\nColonoscopy\nA colonoscopy involves the use of a long tube with a small camera attached. This procedure allows your doctor to see inside your colon and rectum to check for anything unusual. It\ufffds usually performed after less invasive screening tests indicate that you might have colon cancer.\nDuring a colonoscopy, your doctor can also remove tissue from abnormal areas. These tissue samples can then be sent to a laboratory for analysis.\nOut of the existing diagnostic methods, sigmoidoscopies and colonoscopies are the most effective at detecting benign growths that may develop into colon cancer.\nThe USPSTF and the ACS\nrecommend a colonoscopy every 10 years.\nX-ray\nYour doctor may order an X-ray using a contrast solution that contains the chemical element barium.\nYour doctor inserts this liquid into your bowels through the use of a barium enema. Once in place, the barium solution coats the lining of the colon. This helps improve the quality of the X-ray images.\nCT scan\nCT scans provide your doctor with a detailed image of your colon.

If your DKA is a result of an infection or illness, your doctor will treat that as well, usually with antibiotics.\nFluid replacement\nAt the hospital, your physician will likely give you intravenous (IV) fluids to help your body rehydrate. During a DKA event, you usually lose a lot of fluids, which can reduce the amount of blood flowing through your body.\nFluid replacement helps restore typical blood flow. It also helps treat dehydration, which can cause even higher blood sugar levels.\nElectrolyte replacement\nWhen your insulin levels are too low, your body\ufffds electrolytes can also become atypically low.\nElectrolytes are electrically charged minerals that help your body, including the heart and nerves, function properly. Electrolyte replacement is also commonly done through an IV.\nInsulin therapy\nInsulin will likely be administered to you through an IV until your blood sugar level falls below 200 to 250 mg/dL\n. The emergency care team will also monitor several other blood test results that indicate when insulin therapy is no longer needed.\nWhen your blood sugar and other test readings are within an acceptable range, your doctor will work with you to help you avoid DKA in the future."

Generally, the thicker the tumor, the more serious the melanoma. This will affect their treatment plan.\nDiagnosing metastatic melanoma\nIf melanoma is detected, your doctor will run tests to make sure the cancer hasn\ufffdt spread.\nOne of the first tests they may order is a sentinel node biopsy. This involves injecting dye into the area the melanoma was removed from. The dye moves to the nearby lymph nodes. These lymph nodes are then removed and screened for cancer cells. If they\ufffdre cancer free, it typically means the cancer hasn\ufffdt spread.\nIf the cancer is in your lymph nodes, your doctor will use other tests to see if the cancer has spread anywhere else in your body. These include:\nX-rays\nCT scans\nMRI scans\nPET scans\nBlood tests"

Doctors may also prescribe interferon after surgery to reduce the likelihood of the cancer spreading.\nYour doctor may suggest radiation, immunotherapy, or chemotherapy to treat metastatic melanoma. Surgery may be used to remove cancer in other parts of your body.\nMetastatic melanoma is often hard to treat. However, many clinical trials are underway that are looking for new ways to treat the condition.\nComplications caused by treatment\nThe treatments for metastatic melanoma can cause nausea, pain, vomiting, and fatigue.\nRemoval of your lymph nodes can disrupt the lymphatic system. This can lead to fluid buildup and swelling in your limbs, called lymphedema.\nSome people experience confusion or \ufffdmental cloudiness\ufffd during chemotherapy treatment. This is temporary. Others may experience peripheral neuropathy or damage to the nerves from the chemotherapy. This can be permanent."

Straining makes blood pool in the area.\nSitting on the toilet for a long time. This can also put pressure on the tissues around your rectum and anus.\nWeakened support tissues. As you age, the tissues tend to weaken around the anus and rectum.\nPregnancy. Pregnant people may also be at an increased risk of hemorrhoids because of the increased pressure of the abdomen on these veins.\nObesity. Having excess weight has been associated with having hemorrhoids.\nHeavy lifting. You may have a higher risk of hemorrhoids if you frequently lift heavy objects.\nNot eating enough fiber. A low fiber diet may lead to constipation, which can cause hemorrhoids."

You can calculate your BMI by using a calculator\nprovided by the Centers for input Control and Prevention.\nHere are BMI ranges and their corresponding categories of obesity:\nunderweight: under 18.5 percent\nnormal: 18.5 to 24.9 percent\noverweight: 25.0 to 29.9\nobese (class 1): 30.0 and 34.9\nmorbid obesity (class 2): 35-39.9\nUsing BMI as a diagnosis tool for obesity has limitations. Your BMI is only an estimate of your body fat. For example, athletes may have a high weight because of their higher muscle mass. They could fall into the BMI range of obesity or morbid obesity, but actually have a small amount of body fat. Because of this, your doctor might use other tests to get an exact reading of your body fat percentage.\nCalculating Body Fat Percentage\nA skinfold test may also be done to check your body fat percentage. In this test, a doctor measures the thickness of a fold of skin from the arm, abdomen, or thigh with a caliper. Another way to test body fat percentage includes bioelectrical impedance, which is often done using a special type of scale.

Pregnant women are treated with beta-lactam antibiotics for at least 24 hours until their symptoms improve.\nTo prevent pyelonephritis in pregnant women, a urine culture should be conducted between the 12th and 16th weeks of pregnancy. A UTI that doesn\ufffdt have symptoms can lead to the development of pyelonephritis. Detecting the UTI early can prevent kidney infection."

Other blood tests can also reveal if your symptoms are caused by another condition, such as anemia.\nTransthoracic echocardiogram\nA transthoracic echocardiogram is a non-radiating imaging test used to view your heart and its valves. This test uses ultrasound waves to create an image of your heart, with the imaging probe placed on the front of your chest. Your doctor can use this imaging test to look for signs of damage or abnormal movements of your heart.\nTransesophageal echocardiogram\nWhen a transthoracic echocardiogram doesn\ufffdt provide enough information to assess your heart accurately, your doctor might order an additional imaging test called a transesophageal echocardiogram. This is used to view your heart by way of your esophagus.\nElectrocardiogram\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) may be requested to get a better view of your heart\ufffds electrical activity. This test can detect an abnormal heart rhythm or rate. A technician will attach 12 to 15 soft electrodes to your skin. These electrodes are attached to electrical leads (wires), which are then attached to the EKG machine.\nChest X-ray\nA collapsed lung or other lung problems can cause some of the same symptoms as endocarditis. A chest X-ray may be used to view your lungs and see if they\ufffdve collapsed or if fluid has built up in them. A buildup of fluid is called pulmonary edema.

Using oxygen can also help speed up\nthe rate at which the lungs reabsorb air from the cavity.\nDraining excess air\nIf the damage is significant or symptoms are severe, a surgeon may need to remove the air or carry out surgery.\nNeedle aspiration and chest tube insertion are two procedures designed to remove excess air from the pleural space in the chest. These can be done at the bedside without requiring general anesthesia.\nIn needle aspiration, the doctor inserts a needle into the cavity and extracts the air using a syringe.\nFor a chest tube insertion, the doctor will insert a hollowed tube between your ribs. This allows air to drain and the lung to reinflate. The tube may remain in place for 2 to 5 days or longer.\nSurgery\nThe doctor may need to carry out a more invasive procedure to see what\ufffds happening in your lungs, like a thoracotomy or thoracoscopy.\nDuring a thoracotomy, your surgeon will create an incision in the pleural space to help them see the problem. During a thoracoscopy, also known as video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), the doctor inserts a tiny camera through the chest wall to examine the lung.\nIf you\ufffdve had repeated episodes of pneumothorax, you may need a small operation to repair any weak areas in the lung where the air is getting through. The doctor may also carry out pleurodesis, in which they stick the lung to the inside of the chest wall.\nOther surgical options include:\nsewing blisters closed\nclosing air leaks\nor removing the collapsed portion of your lung, which is called a lobectomy\nThese interventions can reduce the risk of pneumothorax happening again."

    "output": "Having high bilirubin can be a sign of several conditions. Your doctor will take your symptoms, as well as any other test results, into account to help narrow down a diagnosis.\nGallstones: These develop when substances like cholesterol or bilirubin harden in your gallbladder. Your gallbladder stores bile, a digestive fluid that helps break down fats before they enter your intestines.\nGilbert\ufffds syndrome: This is a genetic liver condition that causes your liver not to process bilirubin properly. This causes the bilirubin to build up in your bloodstream.\nLiver dysfunction: This can be any condition that affects the function of your liver and causes bilirubin to build up in your blood. This is a result of your liver losing its ability to remove and process bilirubin from your bloodstream. Examples include cirrhosis, liver cancer, or autoimmune hepatitis.\nHepatitis: This happens when your liver becomes inflamed, often due to a viral infection. When it\ufffds inflamed, your liver can\ufffdt easily process bilirubin, leading to a buildup of it in your blood.\nBile duct obstruction: Bile ducts connect your liver to your gallbladder and the opening of your small intestine, called the duodenum. They help to move bile, which contains bilirubin, from your liver and gallbladder into your intestines. Bile can\ufffdt be drained adequately if these ducts become inflamed or blocked. This can lead to an increased level of bilirubin.\nIntrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy: This is a temporary condition during the last trimester of pregnancy. It causes bile drainage from your liver to either slow down or stop entirely. This makes it harder for your liver to process bilirubin from your blood, leading to high bilirubin levels.\nHemolytic anemia: This happens when blood cells break down too quickly in your bloodstream. It\ufffds sometimes passed down genetically, but autoimmune conditions, an enlarged spleen, or an infection can also cause it.\nBilirubin levels in newborns\nMany babies have high bilirubin a few days after birth, causing newborn jaundice. This temporary condition usually resolves on its own within a few weeks.\nIt happens because newborns have more red blood cells and break them down more quickly, but their livers are not developed enough to keep up.\nBefore being born, the pregnant person\ufffds liver helps with this task. A newborn\ufffds liver is only about 1%\nas active as an adult\ufffds.\nIn most cases, higher bilirubin levels will lead to jaundice between 1 and 3 days after birth. Bilirubin levels can peak as high as 18 mg/dL on the fourth or fifth day, and jaundice typically clears up within 2 weeks as the liver matures.\nFeeding 8 to 12 times per day helps to promote regular bowel movements, which help to remove bilirubin from the body.\nIf jaundice occurs within the first 24 hours after birth, or if bilirubin levels are especially high or don\ufffdt begin to fall on their own, doctors may intervene with treatments such as:\nphototherapy\nintravenous immunoglobulin treatment\nexchange transfusion"

This treatment helps prevent pulmonary embolisms by stopping clots from entering your lungs.\nFilters do have risks. If they\ufffdre left in for too long, they can actually increase\nthe risk of DVT. Filters should be used for a short-term period until the risk of thromboembolism is reduced, and blood thinners can be used.\nSurgery\nYour doctor may suggest surgery to remove a DVT clot in your arm or leg. This is typically only recommended with very large blood clots or clots that cause serious issues, like tissue damage.\nDuring a surgical thrombectomy or surgery to remove a blood clot, your surgeon will make an incision into a blood vessel. They\ufffdll locate and remove the clot. Then, they\ufffdll repair the blood vessel and tissue.\nIn some cases, they may use a small inflating balloon to keep the blood vessel open while they remove the clot. When the clot is found and removed, the balloon is removed with it.\nSurgery isn\ufffdt without risks, so many doctors will recommend it only in severe cases. Risks include:\ninfection\ndamage to the blood vessel\nexcess bleeding\nHome remedies\nOnce a DVT blood clot is diagnosed, your doctor will likely prescribe medication to help thin the blood or break up the clot.\nYou can combine the prescribed medication with home remedies to prevent\nother complications and reduce the risk of future blood clots.\nMove more\nIf possible, take daily walks to improve blood flow. Shorter, frequent walks are better than one long walk.\nKeep your leg or arm elevated\nThis is especially important for the legs. Blood can pool if your feet are on the ground all day. Use a stool or chair to keep your legs elevated and close to level with your hips.\nWear compression stockings\nThese specially designed stockings fit tightly around your feet and become gradually looser as they move up your leg to your knee. The compression helps prevent pooling and swelling, and it increases blood flow.\nMost people don\ufffdt need them, but people at high risk of DVT may find them useful. Compression stockings may be beneficial when you\ufffdre traveling.\nEat healthfully\nEating a nutrient-dense and balanced diet is important for helping to avoid life threatening complications.\nA diet high in fiber, fruits, and vegetables, such as the Mediterranean diet, may be best for people at risk of DVT or those who\ufffdve had DVT before, but research is needed to support this.\nSome vitamins and minerals can interfere with DVT medications. For example, too much vitamin K can bypass warfarin\ufffds ability to thin your blood and prevent a clot.\nReview any vitamins or supplements you take with your doctor, and ask about possible medication interactions. It\ufffds also important you talk with your doctor about any foods or nutrients you should avoid."

If this condition persists over time, such as for months, with repeated attacks, or if there are recurrent problems with gallbladder function, it\ufffds known as chronic cholecystitis.\nThe gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ located on the underside of your liver. It stores bile made by the liver and sends it to the small intestine via the common bile duct (CBD) to aid in the digestion of fats. The CBD connects the liver, the gallbladder, and the pancreas to the small intestine. Gallstones blocking the CBD are the leading cause of cholecystitis. This blockage causes bile to build up in the gallbladder, and that buildup causes the gallbladder to become inflamed.\nIf this happens acutely in the face of chronic inflammation, it is a serious condition. The gallbladder could rupture if it\ufffds not treated properly, and this is considered a medical emergency. Treatment usually involves antibiotics, pain medications, and removal of the gallbladder."

According to the Cleveland Clinic, whether you have gallstones may depend on several factors, including:\ngenetic predisposition\nweight\ngallbladder activity\ndietary habits\nGallstones form when substances in the bile form crystal-like particles. They can range from the size of a grain of sand to the size of a golf ball. The presence of gallstones causes pressure, irritation, and may cause infection. The walls of the gallbladder begin to thicken over time. Eventually, the gallbladder starts to shrink. These changes make it harder for the gallbladder to function properly.\nIn addition to gallstones, cholecystitis can be due to:\ninfection of the CBD drainage system\na CBD blockage\nexcess cholesterol in the gallbladder, which can happen during pregnancy or after rapid weight loss\ndecreased blood supply to the gallbladder because of diabetes\ntumors in the liver or pancreas\ntumors in the gallbladder, which is rare\nWhen you experience repeated or prolonged attacks of cholecystitis, it becomes a chronic condition."

This will help them visualize stones and duct obstructions.\nBlood tests can identify infections in the bloodstream.\nIn cholescintigraphy, or a HIDA scan, an injection of a small amount of radioactive material can help identify abnormal contractions or obstructions of your gallbladder and bile ducts. This is also an accurate method of locating the problem. It can take anywhere from an hour to four hours to get your results back.\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography involves using an endoscope (a long, flexible tube inserted down your throat), dye, and an X-ray to thoroughly examine your organs and find defects or problems.\nIn a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, your doctor will insert contrast dye into your liver with a needle.

Surgery for Hiatal hernias is used if reflux symptoms can not be successfully controlled with medication or if you have a type of hernia called a giant esophageal hernia, also known as intrathoracic stomach.\nTypes of surgery\nWhile hiatal hernias can often be treated with lifestyle changes or medication, some people may need surgery to repair their hiatal hernias.\nSurgery to repair a hiatal hernia may involve tightening your diaphragm and pulling the stomach down from the chest cavity back into the abdomen.\nA surgeon will recommend surgery based on what stage your hiatal hernia is.\nCommon surgical options include\n:\nHiatus repair surgery. This surgery uses sutures and prosthetic mesh to tighten and decrease the size of the enlarged hiatus, which is the opening in the diaphragm that the esophagus travels through on its way to the stomach. It prevents your stomach from bulging upward through the hiatus and is used for early-stage Hiatal hernias.\nNissen Fundoplication. This procedure involves using stitches to wrap the upper part of the stomach, called the fundus, around the bottom portion of the esophagus in order to hold the stomach in place below the diaphragmatic hiatus. The stitches create pressure at the end of your esophagus which prevents stomach acid and food from flowing up from the stomach.\nCollis-Nissen gastroplasty. This surgery is used to lengthen the esophagus in patients with more complex forms of Hiatal hernia due to esophageal shortening. In this procedure, a surgeon will use tissue from the upper part of your stomach to extend your esophagus.\nWhat to expect\nSurgery to repair a hiatal hernia typically takes between 2 and 3 hours\nand is done while you\ufffdre under general anesthesia, so you\ufffdll fall asleep and not feel pain during the procedure.\nSurgery to repair a hiatal hernia can be done using different techniques:\nOpen repair. In an open repair surgery, your surgeon will make a large surgical cut in your belly in order to perform surgery.\nLaparoscopic repair. In laparoscopic surgery, your surgeon will make several small cuts in your belly and insert a thin tube with a small camera through one of the cuts. Surgical tools will be inserted through the other cuts. Your surgeon will use a monitor hooked up to the camera in order to view the inside of your stomach and perform the surgery.\nRecovery\nYou can expect to stay in the hospital for 1 to 2 days after your surgery. Some surgeries may require you to follow a soft or liquid diet and avoid carbonated beverages for a couple of weeks after surgery.\nYou may find that your appetite has decreased following surgery, and some patients may experience diarrhea during the first few days after their hernia repair.\nThere are generally no significant restrictions after hiatal hernia repair surgery, which means it\ufffds ok to walk, climb stairs, have sexual intercourse, or exercise as long as it doesn\ufffdt hurt.\nYour surgeon or doctor will provide more specific guidelines and instructions for your recovery, depending on what type of surgery you have."

Another name for this type is episodic migraine.\nPeople who have episodic migraine have attacks up to 14 days a month. Thus, people with episodic migraine have fewer attacks a month than people with chronic ones.\nVestibular migraine is also known as migraine-associated vertigo. About 1 percent of the general population lives with vestibular migraine. The symptoms affect balance, cause dizziness, or both. People of any age, including children, may experience vestibular migraine attacks.\nIf diagnosed, your doctor may suggest you see a vestibular rehabilitation therapist. They can teach you exercises to help you stay balanced when your symptoms are at their worst. Because these migraine attacks can be so debilitating, you and your doctor may talk about taking preventive medications.\nAccording to the National Headache Foundation, menstrual-related migraine affects up to 60 percent of women who experience any type of migraine. It can occur with or without an aura. Attacks can also happen before, during, or after menstruation and during ovulation.\nResearch has shown that menstrual migraine tends to be more intense, last longer, and have more significant nausea than migraine not associated with the menstrual cycle.\nMigraine aura without headache, also called a silent migraine or visual migraine without headache, occurs when a person has an aura, but doesn\ufffdt get a headache. This type of migraine is more common in people who start having migraines after age 40.\nVisual aura symptoms are most common. With this type of migraine, the aura may gradually occur, with symptoms spreading over several minutes and moving from one symptom to another. After visual symptoms, people may have numbness, speech problems, and/or tingling in the face or hands.\nHormonal migraine, or menstrual migraine, is linked with the female hormones, commonly estrogen.

While researchers still aren\ufffdt clear about what exactly causes that imbalance to happen, there are a few possible reasons:\nToo much cholesterol in your bile\nHaving too much cholesterol in your bile can lead to yellow cholesterol stones. These hard stones may develop if your liver makes more cholesterol than your bile can dissolve.\nToo much bilirubin in your bile\nBilirubin is a chemical produced during the normal breakdown of red blood cells. After it\ufffds created, it passes through the liver and is eventually excreted out of the body.\nSome conditions, such as liver damage and certain blood disorders, cause your liver to produce more bilirubin than it should. Pigment gallstones form when your gallbladder can\ufffdt break down the excess bilirubin. These hard stones are often dark brown or black.\nConcentrated bile due to a full gallbladder\nYour gallbladder needs to be able to empty its bile to function properly.

However, if surgery isn\ufffdt performed, your gallstones may come back \ufffd even with additional treatment. This means you may need to keep an eye on your condition for the majority of your life.\nSurgery\nCholecystectomy, which is surgery to remove the gallbladder, is one of the most common operations\nperformed on adults in the United States. Because the gallbladder isn\ufffdt an essential organ, it\ufffds possible to live a healthy life without it.\nThere are two types of cholecystectomy:\nLaparoscopic cholecystectomy. This is a common surgery that requires general anesthesia. The surgeon will usually make three or four incisions in your abdomen. They\ufffdll then insert a small, lighted device into one of the incisions, check for stones, and carefully remove your gallbladder. You can usually go home on the day of the procedure or the day after if you have no complications.\nOpen cholecystectomy.This surgery is typically performed when the gallbladder is inflamed, infected, or scarred. This surgery may also happen if problems occur during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\nYou may experience loose or watery stools after gallbladder removal. Removing a gallbladder involves rerouting the bile from the liver to the small intestine. Bile no longer goes through the gallbladder and it becomes less concentrated. The immediate result is a laxative effect that can cause diarrhea, but this issue should resolve on its own for most people.\nNonsurgical treatments\nIf surgery can\ufffdt be performed, such as if the patient is a much older individual, there are a few other ways doctors can try to get rid of your gallstones.\nOral dissolution therapy typically includes using the medications ursodiol (Actigall) and chenodiol (Chenix) to break up gallstones. These medications contain bile acids, which work to break up the stones. This treatment is best suited for breaking up cholesterol stones and can take many months or years to work completely.\nShock wave lithotripsy is another option. A lithotripter is a machine that generates shock waves that pass through a person. These shock waves can break gallstones into smaller pieces.\nPercutaneous drainage of the gallbladder involves placing a sterile needle into the gallbladder to aspirate (draw out) bile. A tube is then inserted to help with additional drainage. This procedure isn\ufffdt typically a first line of defense and tends to be an option for individuals who may not be suited for other procedures."

    "output": "Your intestines are about 28 feet long. This means the foods you eat have a long way to travel before they\ufffdre fully digested and excreted.\nYour intestines complete this task using muscle contractions that move in a wave-like motion. Known as peristalsis, these muscle contractions move your digested food forward.\nHowever, if something such as muscle or nerve problems slows down or blocks this motion, the result can be a major traffic jam in your intestines.\nIleus is the medical term for this lack of movement somewhere in the intestines that leads to a buildup and potential blockage of food material.\nAn ileus can lead to an intestinal obstruction. This means no food material, gas, or liquids can get through.\nIt can occur as a side effect after surgery. However, there are other causes of this condition.\nAn ileus is a serious concern. However, people with an ileus often don\ufffdt know that food is building up in their intestines, so they continue to eat. This pushes more and more material toward the buildup.\nWithout treatment, the ileus can perforate or tear the intestine.

This is a type of paralytic ileus.\nIn this instance, the intestine is not blocked. Rather, it isn\ufffdt moving properly.

These include:\nintestinal cancer\ndiverticulitis\nParkinson\ufffds input, which affects muscles and nerves in the intestines\nCrohn\ufffds input, which rarely causes a blockage but may cause the intestinal walls to thicken due to autoimmune inflammation\nThese are the most common causes of an ileus in adults. Children can also have an ileus.\nIntussusception is the most common cause of an ileus in children. This is when a part of the intestine \ufffdtelescopes\ufffd or slides into itself.\nGastrointestinal symptoms are the most common signs of an ileus. Your stomach and intestines will start to fill with gas that can\ufffdt pass out the rectum. This causes the abdomen to take on a tight and swollen appearance.\nIf you experience these symptoms, especially after surgery, it\ufffds important to seek immediate medical attention."

    "output": "The treatment for an ileus depends on its severity. The severity can depend on whether it\ufffds causing a partial or complete intestinal obstruction, or if it\ufffds a paralytic ileus.\nPartial obstruction\nSometimes a condition like Crohn\ufffds input or diverticulitis will mean that part of the intestine is not moving. However, some bowel material can get through.\nIn this instance, if you are otherwise stable, your doctor may recommend a low-fiber diet. This can help reduce the bulky stool, making it easier to pass.\nHowever, if that doesn\ufffdt work, surgery may be needed to repair or move the affected portion of the bowel.\nComplete obstruction\nA complete obstruction is a medical emergency.\nTreatment will depend on your overall health. For example, extensive abdominal surgery is not suitable for some people. This includes older adults and those with colon cancer.\nIn this case, a doctor may use a metal stent to make the intestine more open. Ideally, food will start to pass with the stent.\nAbdominal surgery to remove the blockage or the damaged intestine portion may still be needed, however.\nParalytic ileus\nTreatment for a paralytic ileus starts by figuring out the underlying cause.\nIf medication is the cause, your doctor may be able to prescribe another medication to stimulate gastrointestinal motility (intestine movement). One medication they may prescribe is metoclopramide (Reglan).\nIf possible, discontinuing the medications that caused the ileus can also help. However, you should not stop taking a medication, especially an antidepressant, without your doctor\ufffds approval.\nTreatment without surgery is possible during the early stages of a paralytic ileus. You may still require a hospital stay to get the proper fluids intravenously until the issue is fully resolved.\nIn addition to intravenous fluid hydration, your doctor may use nasogastric decompression. During this procedure, a tube is inserted into your nasal cavity to reach your stomach. The tube suctions out the extra air and material that you may otherwise vomit.\nMost surgery-related ileus will resolve within 2 to 4 days after surgery. However, some people do require surgery if the condition does not improve.\nConsiderations for surgery\nYour intestines are very long, so you can live without a portion of them. While it may affect the digestive process, most people do live a healthy life with part of their intestine removed.\nIn some instances, your doctor may have to remove your entire intestine. In this case, your doctor will create a special pouch called an ostomy. This bag allows stool to drain from your remaining gastrointestinal tract.\nYou have to care for the ostomy, but you can live without your intestine after an ileus."

Your doctor will also listen with a stethoscope to your abdomen for typical bowel sounds.\nIf your bowels aren\ufffdt moving because of an ileus, your doctor may not hear anything or may hear excessive bowel sounds.\nImaging studies are usually ordered after a thorough physical exam. These can indicate where an ileus is located by showing a buildup of gas, an enlarged intestine, or even an obstruction. Your doctor may use these to identify areas where your bowel content seems to be concentrated.\nExamples of imaging studies include:\nPlain film X-ray. This may show signs of trapped gas and possibly the obstruction, but plain film X-rays aren\ufffdt always the most conclusive way to diagnose an ileus.\nCT scan. This scan provides more detailed X-ray images to help your doctor identify the potential area where the ileus is located. A CT scan typically uses contrast agents injected intravenously or taken orally.\nUltrasound. An ultrasound is more commonly used to identify an ileus in children.\nIn some instances, your doctor may use a diagnostic procedure known as an air or barium enema.\nDuring this procedure, the doctor inserts air or barium sulfate, a radiopaque substance, through your rectum into your colon. While the doctor does this, a technician takes X-rays of your abdomen. The air or barium shows up on the X-ray to help the technician view any potential obstruction.\nIn some children, this procedure can treat an ileus caused by intussusception."

This allows the surgeon to access your intestines.\nSometimes normal peristalsis can be slow to return. Other people are more likely to later experience scar tissue formation that can also lead to an ileus.\nA number of medical conditions can increase your risk of ileus.

Dead tissue weakens the intestinal wall, making it easy for the intestine to tear and leak bowel contents. This is known as a bowel perforation.\nPeritonitis\nA bowel perforation due to necrosis can cause peritonitis. This is a serious inflammation in the abdominal cavity caused by bacteria or fungus.\nYour bowel contains many bacteria, like E. coli.

It\ufffds also possible for both sides of your heart to fail at the same time.\nHeart failure is also classified as either diastolic or systolic.\nLeft-sided heart failure\nLeft-sided heart failure is the most common type of heart failure.\nThe left ventricle is located in the bottom left side of your heart. This area pumps oxygen-rich blood to the rest of your body.\nLeft-sided heart failure occurs when the left ventricle doesn\ufffdt pump efficiently. This prevents your body from getting enough oxygen-rich blood. The blood backs up into your lungs instead, which causes shortness of breath and a buildup of fluid.\nRight-sided heart failure\nThe right heart ventricle is responsible for pumping blood to your lungs to collect oxygen. Right-sided heart failure occurs when the right side of your heart can\ufffdt perform its job effectively.\nIt\ufffds usually triggered by left-sided heart failure. The accumulation of blood in the lungs caused by left-sided heart failure makes the right ventricle work harder. This can stress the right side of the heart and cause it to fail.\nRight-sided heart failure can also occur because of other conditions, such as lung input or valve input. Right-sided heart failure is marked by swelling of the lower extremities or abdomen. This swelling is caused by fluid backup in the legs, feet, and abdomen.\nDiastolic heart failure\nDiastolic heart failure occurs when the heart muscle becomes stiffer than normal. The stiffness, which is usually due to heart input, means that your heart doesn\ufffdt fill with blood easily. This is known as diastolic dysfunction. It leads to a lack of blood flow to the rest of the organs in your body.\nDiastolic heart failure is more common in people who are female than in those who are male.\nSystolic heart failure\nSystolic heart failure occurs when the heart muscle loses its ability to contract. The contractions of the heart are necessary to pump oxygen-rich blood out to the body. This problem is known as systolic dysfunction, and it usually develops when your heart is weak and may be enlarged.\nSystolic heart failure is more common in males than in females.\nBoth diastolic and systolic heart failure can occur on the left or right sides of the heart.

Some medications are completely off-limits to people with heart failure, including naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) and ibuprofen (Advil, Midol).\nSurgery\nBypass surgery\nSome people with heart failure will need surgery, such as coronary bypass surgery. During this surgery, your surgeon will take a healthy piece of an artery or vein and attach it to the blocked coronary artery. This allows the blood to bypass the blocked, damaged artery and flow through the new one.\nPercutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)\nYour doctor may also suggest a procedure known as a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In this procedure, a catheter with a small balloon attached is inserted into the blocked or narrowed artery. Once the catheter reaches the damaged artery, your surgeon inflates a balloon to open the artery.\nYour surgeon may need to place a permanent stent, or wire mesh tube, into the blocked or narrowed artery. A stent permanently holds your artery open and can help prevent further narrowing of the artery.\nPacemakers\nOther people with heart failure will need pacemakers to help control heart rhythms. These small devices are placed into the chest. They can slow your heart rate when the heart is beating too quickly or increase your heart rate if the heart is beating too slowly. Pacemakers are often used along with bypass surgery as well as medications.\nImplantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)\nAn ICD is a battery-powered device that keeps track of your heart rate and will shock your heart if it detects an abnormal heart rhythm. This shock restores the heart rate back to a normal rhythm. An ICD is suggested for people with an ejection fraction (how much blood your heart pumps out with each contraction) less than 35 percent (if not due to blockages) and <30 percent if due to blockages.\nTransplant surgery\nHeart transplants are used in the final stages of heart failure when all other treatments have failed. During a transplant, your surgeon removes all or part of your heart and replaces it with a heart from a donor."

However, they\ufffdre typically temporary and disappear after a few minutes or hours, when the blockage moves and blood flow is restored.\nA blood clot usually causes a TIA. While it\ufffds not technically categorized as a full stroke, a TIA serves as a warning that an actual stroke may happen. Because of this, it\ufffds best not to ignore it. Seek the same treatment you would for a major stroke and get emergency medical help.\nAccording to the CDC\n, more than one-third of people who experience a TIA and don\ufffdt get treatment have a major stroke within a year. Up to 10 to 15 percent of people who experience a TIA have a major stroke within 3 months.\nHemorrhagic stroke\nA hemorrhagic stroke happens when an artery in the brain breaks open or leaks blood. The blood from that artery creates excess pressure in the skull and swells the brain, damaging brain cells and tissues.\nThe two types of hemorrhagic strokes are intracerebral and subarachnoid:\nAn intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke is the most common type of hemorrhagic stroke. It happens when the tissues surrounding the brain fill with blood after an artery bursts.\nA subarachnoid hemorrhagic stroke is less common. It causes bleeding in the area between the brain and the tissues that cover it.\nAccording to the American Heart Association, about 13 percent\nof strokes are hemorrhagic."

The CDC recommends that adults get at least 2.5 hours\nof aerobic exercise every week. This can mean simply a brisk walk a few times a week.\nHeavy alcohol use\nThe risk of stroke also increases with heavy alcohol use.\nIf you drink, drink in moderation. This means no more than one drink a day for women, and no more than two drinks a day for men.\nHeavy alcohol use can raise blood pressure levels. It can also raise triglyceride levels, which can cause atherosclerosis. This is plaque buildup in the arteries that narrows blood vessels.\nTobacco use\nUsing tobacco in any form also raises the risk of stroke, since it can damage the blood vessels and heart. Nicotine also raises blood pressure.\nPersonal background\nThere are some risk factors for stroke you can\ufffdt control, such as:\nFamily history. Stroke risk is higher in some families because of genetic health factors, such as high blood pressure.\nSex. According to the CDC\n, while both women and men can have strokes, they\ufffdre more common in women than in men in all age groups.\nAge.

According to the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association, \ufffdTime lost is brain lost.\ufffd\nCall 911 or local emergency services as soon as you realize you may be having a stroke, or if you suspect someone else is having a stroke.\nTreatment for stroke depends on the type of stroke:\nIschemic stroke and TIA\nSince a blood clot or blockage in the brain causes these stroke types, they\ufffdre largely treated with similar techniques. They can include:\nClot-breaking drugs\nThrombolytic drugs can break up blood clots in your brain\ufffds arteries, which will stop the stroke and reduce damage to the brain.\nOne such drug, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), or Alteplase IV r-tPA, is considered the gold standard\nin ischemic stroke treatment.\nThis drug works by dissolving blood clots quickly.\nPeople who receive a tPA injection are more likely to recover from a stroke and less likely to have any lasting disability as a result of the stroke.\nMechanical thrombectomy\nDuring this procedure, a doctor inserts a catheter into a large blood vessel inside your head. They then use a device to pull the clot out of the vessel. This surgery is most successful if it\ufffds performed 6 to 24 hours\nafter the stroke begins.\nStents\nIf a doctor finds where artery walls have weakened, they may perform a procedure to inflate the narrowed artery and support the walls of the artery with a stent.\nSurgery\nIn the rare instances that other treatments don\ufffdt work, surgery can remove a blood clot and plaques from your arteries.\nThis surgery may be done with a catheter. If the clot is especially large, a surgeon may open an artery to remove the blockage.\nHemorrhagic stroke\nStrokes caused by bleeds or leaks in the brain require different treatment strategies. Treatments for hemorrhagic stroke include:\nMedications\nUnlike with an ischemic stroke, if you\ufffdre having a hemorrhagic stroke, the treatment goal is to make your blood clot. Therefore, you may be given medication to counteract any blood thinners you take.\nYou may also be prescribed drugs that can:\nreduce blood pressure\nlower the pressure in your brain\nprevent seizures\nprevent blood vessel constriction\nCoiling\nDuring this procedure, your doctor guides a long tube to the area of hemorrhage or weakened blood vessel. They then install a coil-like device in the area where the artery wall is weak. This blocks blood flow to the area, reducing bleeding.\nClamping\nDuring imaging tests, your doctor may discover an aneurysm that hasn\ufffdt started bleeding yet or has stopped.\nTo prevent additional bleeding, a surgeon may place a tiny clamp at the base of the aneurysm. This cuts off blood supply and prevents a possible broken blood vessel or new bleeding.\nSurgery\nIf your doctor sees that an aneurysm has burst, they may do surgery to clip the aneurysm and prevent additional bleeding. Likewise, a craniotomy may be needed to relieve the pressure on the brain after a large stroke.\nIn addition to emergency treatment, your healthcare team will advise you on ways to prevent future strokes."

It\ufffds the only medication currently available that can do this, but it must be given within 3 to 4.5 hours after symptoms of a stroke begin.\nThis drug is injected into a blood vessel so the medication can start to work as quickly as possible, which reduces the risk of complications from the stroke.\nAnticoagulants\nThese drugs reduce your blood\ufffds ability to clot. The most common anticoagulant is warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven).\nThese drugs can also prevent existing blood clots from growing larger, which is why doctors may prescribe them to prevent a stroke, or after an ischemic stroke or TIA has occurred.\nAntiplatelet drugs\nThese medications prevent blood clots by making it more difficult for the blood\ufffds platelets to stick together. The most common antiplatelet drugs include aspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix).\nThe drugs can prevent ischemic strokes. They\ufffdre especially important in preventing secondary stroke.\nIf you\ufffdve never had a stroke before, only use aspirin as a preventive medication if you have a high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular input (e.g., heart attack and stroke) and a low risk of bleeding.\nStatins\nStatins help lower high blood cholesterol levels. They\ufffdre among the most commonly prescribed\nmedications in the United States.\nThese drugs prevent the production of an enzyme that can turn cholesterol into plaque \ufffd the thick, sticky substance that can build up on the walls of arteries and cause strokes and heart attacks.\nCommon statins include:\nrosuvastatin (Crestor)\nsimvastatin (Zocor)\natorvastatin (Lipitor)\nBlood pressure drugs\nHigh blood pressure can cause pieces of plaque buildup in your arteries to break off.

They\ufffdre typically taken through an inhaler or nebulizer.\nShort-acting bronchodilators last from 4 to 6 hours. You only use them when you need them. For ongoing symptoms, there are long-acting versions you can use every day.

They also help your body clear mucus from the lungs. These two types of bronchodilators can be taken in combination by inhaler or with a nebulizer.\n\nHere\ufffds a list of recommended LABA/LAMA bronchodilator therapies:\naclidinium/formoterol\nglycopyrrolate/formoterol\ntiotropium/olodaterol\numeclidinium/vilanterol\nCorticosteroids\nLong-acting bronchodilators are commonly combined with inhaled glucocorticosteroids. A glucocorticosteroid can reduce inflammation in the airways and lower mucus production.\nThe long-acting bronchodilator can relax the airway muscle to help the airways stay wider. Corticosteroids are also available in pill form.\nPhosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors\nThis type of medication can be taken in pill form to help reduce inflammation and relax the airways. It\ufffds generally prescribed for severe COPD with chronic bronchitis.\nTheophylline\nThis medication eases chest tightness and shortness of breath. It may also help prevent flare-ups.

Salicylates can thin the blood, so they should not be used with additional blood thinning medications.\nMenthol or capsaicin creams. These creams block the transmission of pain signals from your joints.\nSteroids, like prednisone, help reduce inflammation but should be used cautiously and for brief periods of time.\nImmunosuppressants and biologics. Immunosuppressants and biologics are prescribed for moderate to severe inflammatory arthritis like RA.\nIf you have RA, your doctor may recommend corticosteroids or input-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), which suppress your immune system.\nDMARDs and biologics are being prescribed earlier in the course of RA. Methotrexate is now a first-line drug for treatment.\nThere are also many medications to treat OA available over the counter or by prescription.\nSupplements\nWhile clinical evidence and safety data\nare lacking for many herbs and supplements marketed for arthritis, there are a few supplements that may be beneficial. For example, avocado and soybean unsaponifiables (ASU) may help OA symptoms. Fish oil and turmeric supplements may help reduce inflammation in RA.\nHowever, you should talk with your doctor before taking any supplements for arthritis to make sure they are safe for you and will not interact with any medications you\ufffdre currently taking.\nSurgery\nSurgery to replace your joint with an artificial one may be an option. This form of surgery is most commonly performed to replace hips and knees.\nIf your arthritis is most severe in your fingers or wrists, your doctor may perform joint fusion. In this procedure, the ends of your bones are fused, eliminating the joint and therefore eliminating the site of inflammation.\nPhysical therapy\nPhysical therapy involving exercises that help strengthen the muscles around the affected joint is a core component of arthritis treatment.\nOutside of your appointments, your physical therapist will likely recommend a plan of care that includes daily movement along with exercises you can complete on your own at home.

A 2021 review\nreported that up to 17 percent of people admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 had additional infections.\nYou can help prevent both COVID-19 and other infections by taking the following precautions:\nStay up to date on your vaccinations. Get vaccinated for COVID-19, the flu, pneumonia, and other common infections.\nKeep your distance from people outside your household. Avoid non-essential travel and activities, and stay 6 feet away from people you don\ufffdt know.\nWear a mask. Masks help protect you and others from respiratory infections. Wear a mask in indoor public spaces, like grocery stores and movie theaters.\nPractice good hygiene. This means practicing proper wound care, hand-washing, and bathing regularly.\nGet immediate care if you develop signs of infection. Every minute counts when it comes to sepsis treatment. The sooner you get treatment, the better the outcome."

They can also appear in a small section or cover multiple areas. For example, a measles-related rash starts on your cheeks before eventually spreading to your torso and limbs.\nViral rashes might also feel itchy or painful to the touch. The best way to identify a viral rash is to check for any symptoms of a viral infection, such as:\nfever\nchills\nbody aches\nfatigue\nMeasles\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral infection. It can cause many symptoms, including a rash that starts on the face and spreads to the body. phichet chaiyabin/Shutterstock\nMeasles is a highly contagious input among people who are not protected by a vaccine. It can be dangerous in young children and infants.\nThe measles rash generally starts off as a red, blotchy rash on the face. Over the course of a few days, it can spread to the torso and then the rest of the body.\nThe rash typically consists of flat pink or red spots that appear 3 to 5 days\nafter infection. On darker skin, it can be flesh-colored to slightly purplish-gray, with flat to slightly raised bumps.\nThe rash occurs because your immune system detects the virus as it travels through your bloodstream. Immune cells then release chemicals to destroy the virus. However, these chemicals also cause skin inflammation, resulting in a rash.\nSymptoms of measles infection may include:\nhigh fever with spikes of more than 104\ufffd F (40\ufffd C)\ncough\nrunny nose\nconjunctivitis, a condition where the eyes become red and watery\nblotchy rash that spreads from the face to the body\nGerman measles (rubella)\nRubella is a viral illness that causes a rash on the face that spreads to the rest of the body. Akkalak Aiempradit/Shutterstock\nThe rubella virus, also known as German measles, typically causes mild illness in both children and adults. However, this can cause stillbirth or miscarriage and severe birth defects in developing babies.\nPeople with rubella can pass the virus to others by sneezing and coughing as well as through their saliva. They may be contagious for a full week before they develop a rash. They\ufffdll usually continue to be contagious for another week after the rash appears.\nThe rash caused by German measles typically starts on the face, and within 3 days, it spreads to the rest of the body. The rash can appear red on light skin.

This virus is common in teenagers and young adults but can occur at any age. A rash may occur with infection, though it is not the primary symptom.\nLike its nickname \ufffd the kissing input \ufffd suggests, mono is passed through bodily fluids like saliva.\nMono can have three different types of rashes. Mono rashes can appear as:\nA generalized rash. This looks like generalized red spots on lighter skin to pinkish-purple on darker skin, and it can be either flat or small bumps.\nA drug rash. Mono is caused by a virus and isn\ufffdt treated with an antibiotic. Someone may be mistakenly diagnosed with strep throat and treated with an antibiotic, which may result in a drug rash.

If you have had chickenpox, you are at risk of developing shingles.\nThe risk of reactivating the virus increases with age, and 1 out of every 2 people in the United States will develop shingles in their lifetime, according to the CDC\n.\nYou can get shingles from direct contact with blisters or the fluid inside them.\nShingles involves a reactivation of the chickenpox virus that\ufffds lying dormant in your nerves. When the virus reactivates, it travels down your nerves to your skin. As the virus spreads there, the shingles rash begins to form.\nThough similar to chickenpox spots in children, the shingles rash and illness are often more severe in adults. Older adults may also be at risk for complications such as nerve pain, blindness, and neurological conditions.\nPeople who develop shingles often note that pain occurred at the site where the rash develops.

Hearing this click might lead your doctor to order further tests.\nYour doctor may order an X-ray or an echocardiogram. Both of these tests provide images of your heart, but the echocardiogram shows more structural details. Your doctor can check the images to see if you have MVP or regurgitation. Depending on your condition, your doctor may also perform a cardiac catheterization. In this procedure, dye (which is visible on X-rays) is injected into the arteries of your heart using a catheter (tube) that has been threaded through a blood vessel in your neck, arm, or upper thigh.\nYour doctor might ask you to exercise on a treadmill or perform some other physical activity to see how your heart responds.

Strep throat is a contagious condition caused by Streptococcus bacteria.\nCalcification of the valves\nAortic valve stenosis can happen due to calcium buildup (calcification) or scarring of the aortic valve. Aortic valve stenosis may occur in as many as 20% of older adults, according to the American Heart Association\n. It is most common in people age 65 and older.\nWhile your body needs calcium for strong bones, the mineral may lead to problems in your heart if it deposits in the aortic valve. Calcium deposits usually affect the leaflets of the aortic valve. They can prevent the aortic valve from properly opening and closing.\nImproperly functioning aortic valve leaflets may also allow blood to leak back into the left ventricle after it enters the aorta. This is called valvular insufficiency or regurgitation.\nIt may also be more common\nin people with certain health conditions, including lupus and end-stage renal input.\nHeart defect\nChildren may experience aortic valve stenosis due to a heart defect where the aortic valve doesn\ufffdt develop properly. When it is, the aortic valve\ufffds flaps, or \ufffdleaflets,\ufffd irregularly formed. Typically, these leaflets make up the opening of the aortic valve.

Arterial ulcers are also sometimes found in the gut in individuals who are ill and have poor blood pressure in general.\nThese forms of ulcers can take months to heal and require proper treatment to prevent infection and further complications.\nArterial ulcers have a \ufffdpunched out\ufffd appearance accompanied by a number of symptoms, including:\nred, yellow, or black sores\nhairless skin\nleg pain\nno bleeding\naffected area cool to the touch from minimal blood circulation\nTreatment for arterial ulcers depends on the underlying cause. Primary treatment includes restoring blood circulation to the affected area.\nWhile antibiotics may help reduce symptoms, your doctor may recommend surgery to increase blood flow to your tissues and organs. In more severe circumstances, your doctor may recommend amputation.\nVenous ulcers\nVenous ulcers \ufffd the most common type of leg ulcers \ufffd are open wounds that often form on your leg, below your knee, and on the inner area of your ankle. They typically develop from damage to your veins caused by insufficient blood flow back to your heart.\nIn some cases, venous ulcers cause little to no pain unless they\ufffdre infected. Other cases of this condition can be very painful.\nOther symptoms you may experience include:\ninflammation\nswelling\nitchy skin\nscabbing\ndischarge\nVenous ulcers can take months to fully heal. In rare cases, they may never heal. Treatment focuses on improving flow to the affected area. Antibiotics can help prevent infection and reduce symptoms, but they aren\ufffdt enough to heal venous ulcers.\nAlongside medication, your doctor may recommend surgery or compression therapy to increase blood flow.\nPeptic ulcers\nPeptic ulcers are sores or wounds that can develop on:\nthe inside lining of your stomach\nthe upper portion of your small intestine\nyour esophagus\nThey form when digestive juices damage the walls of your stomach or intestine. These ulcers are quite common.\nPeptic ulcers are most often caused by inflammation after contracting Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria or through long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\nThere are two types of peptic ulcers:\ngastric ulcers, or ulcers that develop in the stomach lining\nduodenal ulcers, or ulcers that develop in the duodenum (small intestine)\nThe most common symptom of this condition is a burning sensation. Other symptoms may include:\nbloating or the feeling of being full\nbelching\nheartburn\nnausea\nvomiting\nunexplained weight loss\nchest pain\nTreatment depends on the underlying cause of your ulcer. If you have an H. pylori infection, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to kill the harmful bacteria.\nFor the majority of peptic ulcer cases, acid-lowering medication regimens are generally prescribed to help protect the mucosal lining from stomach acid so it has time to heal.\nMouth ulcers\nMouth ulcers are small sores or lesions that develop in your mouth or the base of your gums. They\ufffdre commonly known as canker sores.\nThese ulcers are triggered by a number of causes\n, including:\nstress\nhormonal changes\nvitamin deficiencies\nbacterial infection\ninputs\nMouth ulcers are common and often go away within 2 weeks. They can be uncomfortable but shouldn\ufffdt cause significant pain. If a mouth ulcer is extremely painful or doesn\ufffdt go away within 2 weeks, seek immediate medical attention.\nMinor mouth ulcers appear as small, round ulcers that leave no scarring. In more severe cases, they can develop into larger and deeper wounds. Other serious symptoms associated with this type of ulcer may include:\nunusually slow healing (lasting longer than 3 weeks)\nulcers that extend to your lips\nissues eating or drinking\nfever\ndiarrhea\nMouth ulcers often go away on their own without treatment. If they become painful, your doctor or dentist may prescribe an antimicrobial mouthwash or ointment to reduce your discomfort.\nIf your condition is the result of a more serious infection, seek medical attention to receive the best treatment.\nGenital ulcers\nGenital ulcers are sores that develop on genital areas, including the penis, vagina, anus, or surrounding areas. They are usually caused by sexually transmitted infections (STIs), but genital ulcers can also be triggered by trauma, inflammatory inputs, or even, in some cases\n, an Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) infection.\nIn addition to sores, symptoms that may accompany genital ulcers include:\nrash or bumps in the affected area\npain or itching\nswollen glands in the groin area\nfever\nSimilar to other types of ulcers, treatment depends on the underlying cause of your condition. In some cases, these sores will go away on their own. If diagnosed with an STI, your doctor may prescribe antiviral or antibiotic medication or ointment.

It\ufffds also possible for both sides of your heart to fail at the same time.\nHeart failure is also classified as either diastolic or systolic.\nLeft-sided heart failure\nLeft-sided heart failure is the most common type of heart failure.\nThe left ventricle is located in the bottom left side of your heart. This area pumps oxygen-rich blood to the rest of your body.\nLeft-sided heart failure occurs when the left ventricle doesn\ufffdt pump efficiently. This prevents your body from getting enough oxygen-rich blood. The blood backs up into your lungs instead, which causes shortness of breath and a buildup of fluid.\nRight-sided heart failure\nThe right heart ventricle is responsible for pumping blood to your lungs to collect oxygen. Right-sided heart failure occurs when the right side of your heart can\ufffdt perform its job effectively.\nIt\ufffds usually triggered by left-sided heart failure. The accumulation of blood in the lungs caused by left-sided heart failure makes the right ventricle work harder. This can stress the right side of the heart and cause it to fail.\nRight-sided heart failure can also occur because of other conditions, such as lung input or valve input. Right-sided heart failure is marked by swelling of the lower extremities or abdomen. This swelling is caused by fluid backup in the legs, feet, and abdomen.\nDiastolic heart failure\nDiastolic heart failure occurs when the heart muscle becomes stiffer than normal. The stiffness, which is usually due to heart input, means that your heart doesn\ufffdt fill with blood easily. This is known as diastolic dysfunction. It leads to a lack of blood flow to the rest of the organs in your body.\nDiastolic heart failure is more common in people who are female than in those who are male.\nSystolic heart failure\nSystolic heart failure occurs when the heart muscle loses its ability to contract. The contractions of the heart are necessary to pump oxygen-rich blood out to the body. This problem is known as systolic dysfunction, and it usually develops when your heart is weak and may be enlarged.\nSystolic heart failure is more common in males than in females.\nBoth diastolic and systolic heart failure can occur on the left or right sides of the heart.

Some medications are completely off-limits to people with heart failure, including naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) and ibuprofen (Advil, Midol).\nSurgery\nBypass surgery\nSome people with heart failure will need surgery, such as coronary bypass surgery. During this surgery, your surgeon will take a healthy piece of an artery or vein and attach it to the blocked coronary artery. This allows the blood to bypass the blocked, damaged artery and flow through the new one.\nPercutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)\nYour doctor may also suggest a procedure known as a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In this procedure, a catheter with a small balloon attached is inserted into the blocked or narrowed artery. Once the catheter reaches the damaged artery, your surgeon inflates a balloon to open the artery.\nYour surgeon may need to place a permanent stent, or wire mesh tube, into the blocked or narrowed artery. A stent permanently holds your artery open and can help prevent further narrowing of the artery.\nPacemakers\nOther people with heart failure will need pacemakers to help control heart rhythms. These small devices are placed into the chest. They can slow your heart rate when the heart is beating too quickly or increase your heart rate if the heart is beating too slowly. Pacemakers are often used along with bypass surgery as well as medications.\nImplantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)\nAn ICD is a battery-powered device that keeps track of your heart rate and will shock your heart if it detects an abnormal heart rhythm. This shock restores the heart rate back to a normal rhythm. An ICD is suggested for people with an ejection fraction (how much blood your heart pumps out with each contraction) less than 35 percent (if not due to blockages) and <30 percent if due to blockages.\nTransplant surgery\nHeart transplants are used in the final stages of heart failure when all other treatments have failed. During a transplant, your surgeon removes all or part of your heart and replaces it with a heart from a donor."

A speech-language pathologist will perform a swallowing evaluation to diagnose your dysphagia. Once the evaluation is completed, the speech-language pathologist may recommend:\ndietary changes\noropharyngeal swallowing exercises to strengthen muscles\nalternative swallowing strategies\nposture changes that you should follow while eating\nHowever, if swallowing problems are persistent, they can result in malnutrition and dehydration, especially in the very young and in older adults.\nRecurrent respiratory infections and aspiration pneumonia are also likely. All of these complications are serious and life threatening and must be treated definitively.\nVarious treatments may be prescribed depending on the medical condition causing swallowing difficulty:\nAchalasia. If this is causing your swallowing problem, a procedure called esophageal dilation may be used to expand the esophagus. During this procedure, a small balloon is placed into the esophagus to widen it. The balloon is then removed.\nAbnormal growths in the esophagus. Surgery may be necessary to remove them. Surgery may also be used to remove scar tissue.\nAcid reflux or ulcers. You may be given prescription medication to treat these conditions and encouraged to follow a reflux diet.\nMedications. If your swallowing difficulty is related to GERD, prescription oral medications can help reduce stomach acid. Corticosteroids might be recommended for eosinophilic esophagitis. For esophageal spasm, smooth muscle relaxants might help.\nIn severe cases or acute cases of swallowing difficulty, you may be admitted to the hospital. Treatments you may receive there include:\nFeeding tube. You may receive enteral feeding, which is when you receive food through a tube that goes directly into the stomach and bypasses the esophagus.\nModified diets.

Achilles gives tips like these in her book:\nDownsize dish, cup, and utensil size. This will necessitate smaller bites, which is important for people with swallowing difficulty.\nAlways think about texture. Make it appealing. For example, put meringue on custard.\nEmphasize taste and aroma. This will overpower unappealing soft textures and help make food appetizing.\nMake the environment nice. A pretty table setting, flowers, and a simple attractive environment can do wonders for the appetite.\nIt\ufffds important to note that dysphagia with a neurologic cause may present differently than dysphagia with other causes.\nThe Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services summarizes which foods to eat and which to avoid if you have swallowing difficulty. Here are some of its recommendations for foods to avoid or use only when carefully prepared:\nPeas and corn. These can roll to the back of the throat and create a choking hazard unless carefully prepared into a puree or porridge.\nMeat. Meats can be tiring to chew and can get stuck in the throat or esophagus. Again, proper preparation is necessary.\nRice. It can get stuck in the throat and fall into the airway. It is usable if properly prepared.\nIce cream. Its consistency changes when it melts, and it may become too thin for some people with swallowing difficulty.\nBread. People tend to swallow it too soon, and balls of it become lodged in airways. Gelled bread can be used instead.\nPeanut butter. It can be hard for people with swallowing difficulty to process peanut butter, and it may block the airways if aspirated (inhaled into the airway). It cannot be removed by a Heimlich maneuver.\nFibrous cooked vegetables. Some examples include cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and asparagus.\nFresh fruits.
